We consider a qubit coupled to another system (its environment), and discuss the relationship between
the effects of subjecting the qubit to either a dynamical decoupling sequence of unitary operations,
or a sequence of projective measurements. We give a formal statement concerning equivalence of
a sequence of coherent operations on a qubit, precisely operations from a minimal set $\left\{1_Q,\hat{\sigma}_x\right\}$,
and a sequence of projective measurements of $\hat{\sigma}_x$ observable. Using it we show that
when a qubit is subjected to $n$ such successive projective measurements at certain times, the expectation
value of the last measurement can be expressed as a linear combination of expectation values of $\hat{\sigma}_x$
observed after subjecting the qubit to dynamical decoupling sequences of $\pi$ pulses, with $k\leq
n$ of them applied at subsets of these times. Performing a sequence of measurements on the qubit gives
then the same information about qubit decoherence and dynamics of environment as that contained
in dynamical decoupling signal. Analyzing the latter has been widely used to gain information about
the environmental dynamics (perform so-called noise spectroscopy), so our result shows how all
the data obtained for dynamical decoupling based protocols is related to those that can be obtained
just by performing multiple measurements on the qubit. We also discuss in more detail the application
of the general result to the case of the qubit undergoing pure dephasing, and outline possible extensions
to higher-dimensional (a qudit or multiple qubits) systems.
