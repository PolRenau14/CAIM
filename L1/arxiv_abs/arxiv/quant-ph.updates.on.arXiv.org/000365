The problem of reliably certifying the outcome of a computation performed by a quantum device is
rapidly gaining relevance. We present two protocols for a classical verifier to verifiably delegate
a quantum computation to two non-communicating but entangled quantum provers. Our protocols have
near-optimal complexity in terms of the total resources employed by the verifier and the honest
provers, with the total number of operations of each party, including the number of entangled pairs
of qubits required of the honest provers, scaling as $O(g\log g)$ for delegating a circuit of size
$g$. This is in contrast to previous protocols, which all require a prohibitively large polynomial
overhead. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit
being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit being delegated. The
second protocol is not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction. Our main
technical innovation is an efficient rigidity theorem which allows a verifier to test that two entangled
provers perform measurements specified by an arbitrary $m$-qubit tensor product of single-qubit
Clifford observables on their respective halves of $m$ shared EPR pairs, with a robustness that
is independent of $m$. Our two-prover classical-verifier delegation protocols are obtained by
combining this rigidity theorem with a single-prover quantum-verifier protocol for the verifiable
delegation of a quantum computation, introduced by Broadbent.
