Digital quantum computing paradigm offers highly-desirable features such as universality, scalability,
and quantum error correction. However, physical resource requirements to implement useful error-corrected
quantum algorithms are prohibitive in the current era of NISQ devices. As an alternative path to
performing universal quantum computation, within the NISQ era limitations, we propose to merge
digital single-qubit operations with analog multi-qubit entangling blocks in an approach we call
digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC). Along these lines, although the techniques may be extended
to any resource, we propose to use unitaries generated by the ubiquitous Ising Hamiltonian for the
analog entangling block and we prove its universal character. We construct explicit DAQC protocols
for efficient simulations of arbitrary inhomogeneous Ising, two-body, and $M$-body spin Hamiltonian
dynamics by means of single-qubit gates and a fixed homogeneous Ising Hamiltonian. Additionally,
we compare a sequential approach where the interactions are switched on and off (stepwise DAQC)
with an always-on multi-qubit interaction interspersed by fast single-qubit pulses (banged DAQC).
Finally, we perform numerical tests comparing purely digital schemes with DAQC protocols, showing
a remarkably better performance of the latter. The proposed DAQC approach combines the robustness
of analog quantum computing with the flexibility of digital methods, establishing an avenue for
achieving quantum advantage with near-term quantum hardware.
