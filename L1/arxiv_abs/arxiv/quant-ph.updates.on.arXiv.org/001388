Quantum emitters coupled to plasmonic resonators are known to allow enhanced broadband Purcell
factors, and such systems have been recently suggested as possible candidates for on-demand single
photon sources, with fast operation speeds. However, a true single photon source has strict requirements
of high efficiency (brightness) and quantum indistinguishability of the emitted photons, which
can be quantified through two-photon interference experiments. To help address this problem,
we employ and extend a recently developed quantized quasinormal mode approach, which rigorously
quantizes arbitrarily lossy open system modes, to compute the key parameters that accurately quantify
the figures of merit for plasmon-based single photon sources. We also present a quantized input-output
theory to quantify the radiative and nonradiative quantum efficiencies. We exemplify the theory
using a nanoplasmonic dimer resonator made up of two gold nanorods, which yields large Purcell factors
and good radiative output beta factors. Considering an optically pulsed excitation scheme, we
explore the key roles of pulse duration and pure dephasing on the single photon properties, and show
that ultrashort pulses (sub-ps) are generally required for such structures, even for low temperature
operation. We also quantify the role of the nonradiative beta factor both for single photon and two-photon
emission processes. Our general approach can be applied to a wide variety of plasmon systems, including
metal-dielectrics, and cavity-waveguide systems, without recourse to phenomenological quantization
schemes.
