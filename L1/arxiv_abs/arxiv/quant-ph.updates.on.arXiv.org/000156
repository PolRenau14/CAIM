We revisit the definitions of error and disturbance recently used in error-disturbance inequalities
derived by Ozawa and others by expressing them in the reduced system space. The interpretation of
the definitions as mean-squared deviations relies on an implicit assumption that is generally
incompatible with the Bell-Kochen-Specker-Spekkens contextuality theorems, and which results
in averaging the deviations over a non-positive-semidefinite joint quasiprobability distribution.
For unbiased measurements, the error admits a concrete interpretation as the dispersion in the
estimation of the mean induced by the measurement ambiguity. We demonstrate how to directly measure
not only this dispersion but also every observable moment with the same experimental data, and thus
demonstrate that perfect distributional estimations can have nonzero error according to this
measure. We conclude that the inequalities using these definitions do not capture the spirit of
Heisenberg's eponymous inequality, but do indicate a qualitatively different relationship between
dispersion and disturbance that is appropriate for ensembles being probed by all outcomes of an
apparatus. To reconnect with the discussion of Heisenberg, we suggest alternative definitions
of error and disturbance that are intrinsic to a single apparatus outcome. These definitions naturally
involve the retrodictive and interdictive states for that outcome, and produce complementarity
and error-disturbance inequalities that have the same form as the traditional Heisenberg relation.
