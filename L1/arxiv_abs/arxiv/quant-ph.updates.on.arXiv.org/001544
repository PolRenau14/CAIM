Decoherence is a fundamental obstacle to the implementation of large-scale and low-noise quantum
information processing devices. In this work, we suggest an approach for suppressing errors by
employing pre-processing and post-processing unitary operations, which precede and follow the
action of a decoherence channel. In contrast to quantum error correction and measurement-based
methods, the suggested approach relies on specifically designed unitary operators for a particular
state without the need in ancillary qubits or post-selection procedures. We consider the case of
decoherence channels acting on a single qubit belonging to a many-qubit state. Pre-processing
and post-processing operators can be either individual, that is acting on the qubit effected by
the decoherence channel only, or collective, that is acting on the whole multi-qubit state. We give
a classification of possible strategies for the protection scheme, analyze them, and derive expressions
for the optimal unitary operators providing the maximal value of the fidelity regarding initial
and final states. Specifically, we demonstrate the equivalence of the schemes where one of the unitary
operations is individual while the other is collective. We then consider the realization of our
approach for the basic decoherence models, which include single-qubit depolarizing, dephasing,
and amplitude damping channels. We also demonstrate that the decoherence robustness of multi-qubit
states for these decoherence models is determined by the entropy of the reduced state of the qubit
undergoing the decoherence channel.
