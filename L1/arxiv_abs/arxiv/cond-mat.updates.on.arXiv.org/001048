Multiscale community detection can be viewed from a dynamical perspective within the Markov Stability
framework, which uses the diffusion of a Markov process on the graph to uncover intrinsic network
substructures across all scales. Here we reformulate multiscale community detection as a max-sum
length vector partitioning problem with respect to the set of time-dependent node vectors expressed
in terms of eigenvectors of the transition matrix. This formulation provides a geometric interpretation
of Markov Stability in terms of a time-dependent spectral embedding, where the Markov time acts
as an inhomogeneous geometric resolution factor that zooms the components of the node vectors at
different rates. Our geometric formulation encompasses both modularity and the multi-resolution
Potts model, which are shown to correspond to vector partitioning in a pseudo-Euclidean space,
and is also linked to spectral partitioning methods, where the number of eigenvectors used corresponds
to the dimensionality of the underlying embedding vector space. Inspired by the Louvain optimisation
for community detection, we then propose an algorithm based on a graph-theoretical heuristic for
the vector partitioning problem. We apply the algorithm to the spectral optimisation of modularity
and Markov Stability community detection. The spectral embedding based on the transition matrix
eigenvectors leads to improved partitions with higher information content and higher modularity
than the eigen-decomposition of the modularity matrix. We illustrate the results with random network
benchmarks.
