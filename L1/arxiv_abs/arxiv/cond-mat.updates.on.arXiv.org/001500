Thermoelectric transport is traditionally analyzed using relations imposed by time-reversal
symmetry, ranging from Onsager's results to fluctuation relations in counting statistics. In
this paper, we show that a recently discovered duality relation for fermionic systems -- deriving
from the fundamental fermion-parity superselection principle of quantum many-particle systems
-- provides new insights into thermoelectric transport. Using a master equation, we analyze the
stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled, but strongly interacting single-level
quantum dot subject to electrical and thermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality
shows that features of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the average
and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed by attractive instead of repulsive
electron-electron interaction. In the nonlinear regime, the duality furthermore relates most
transport coefficients to much better understood equilibrium quantities. Finally, we naturally
identify the fermion-parity as the part of the Coulomb interaction relevant for both the linear
and nonlinear Fourier heat. Altogether, our findings hence reveal that next to time-reversal,
the duality imposes equally important symmetry restrictions on thermoelectric transport. As
such, it is also expected to simplify computations and clarify the physical understanding for more
complex systems than the simplest relevant interacting nanostructure model studied here.
