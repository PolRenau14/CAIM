We study self-organisation of collective motion as a thermodynamic phenomenon, in the context
of the first law of thermodynamics. It is expected that the coherent/ordered motion typically self-organises
in the presence of changes in the (generalised) internal energy and of (generalised) work done on,
or extracted from, the system. We aim to explicitly quantify changes in these two quantities in a
system of simulated self-propelled particles, and contrast them with changes in the system's configuration
entropy. In doing so, we adapt a thermodynamic formulation of the curvatures of the internal energy
and the work, with respect to two parameters that control the particles' alignment. This allows
us to systematically investigate the behaviour of the system by varying the two control parameters
to drive the system across a kinetic phase transition. Our results identify critical regimes and
show that during the phase transition, where the configuration entropy of the system decreases,
the rate of change of the work and of the internal energy also decrease, while their curvatures diverge.
Importantly, the reduction of entropy achieved through expenditure of work is shown to peak at criticality.
We relate this both to a thermodynamic efficiency and the significance of the increased order with
respect to a computational path. Additionally, this study provides an information-geometric
interpretation of the curvature of the internal energy as the difference between two curvatures:
the curvature of the free entropy, captured by the Fisher information, and the curvature of the configuration
entropy.
