We develop spectral theory for the q-Hahn stochastic particle system introduced recently by Povolotsky.
That is, we establish a Plancherel type isomorphism result which implies completeness and biorthogonality
statements for the Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the system. Owing to a Markov duality with the
q-Hahn TASEP (a discrete-time generalization of TASEP with particles' jump distribution being
the orthogonality weight for the classical q-Hahn orthogonal polynomials), we write down moment
formulas which characterize the fixed time distribution of the q-Hahn TASEP with general initial
data. The Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the q-Hahn system degenerate into eigenfunctions of other
(not necessarily stochastic) interacting particle systems solvable by the coordinate Bethe ansatz.
This includes the ASEP, the (asymmetric) six-vertex model, and the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain (all
models are on the infinite lattice). In this way, each of the latter systems possesses a spectral
theory, too. In particular, biorthogonality of the ASEP eigenfunctions which follows from the
corresponding q-Hahn statement implies symmetrization identities of Tracy and Widom (for ASEP
with either step or step Bernoulli initial configuration) as corollaries. Another degeneration
takes the q-Hahn system to the q-Boson particle system (dual to q-TASEP) studied in detail in our
previous paper (2013). Thus, at the spectral theory level we unify two discrete-space regularizations
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation / stochastic heat equation, namely, q-TASEP and ASEP.
