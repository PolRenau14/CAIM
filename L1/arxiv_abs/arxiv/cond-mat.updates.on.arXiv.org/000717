We analyze the problem of eliminating finite-size errors from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energy
data. We demonstrate that both (i) adding a recently proposed [S. Chiesa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
97, 076404 (2006)] finite-size correction to the Ewald energy and (ii) using the model periodic
Coulomb (MPC) interaction [L. M. Fraser et al., Phys. Rev. B 53, 1814 (1996); P. R. C. Kent et al., Phys.
Rev. B 59, 1917 (1999); A. J. Williamson et al., Phys. Rev. B 55, 4851 (1997)] are good solutions to
the problem of removing finite-size effects from the interaction energy in cubic systems, provided
the exchange-correlation (XC) hole has converged with respect to system size. However, we find
that the MPC interaction distorts the XC hole in finite systems, implying that the Ewald interaction
should be used to generate the configuration distribution. The finite-size correction of Chiesa
et al. is shown to be incomplete in systems of low symmetry. Beyond-leading-order corrections to
the kinetic energy are found to be necessary at intermediate and high densities, and we investigate
the effect of adding such corrections to QMC data for the homogeneous electron gas. We analyze finite-size
errors in two-dimensional systems and show that the leading-order behavior differs from that which
has hitherto been supposed. We compare the efficiency of different twist-averaging methods for
reducing single-particle finite-size errors and we examine the performance of various finite-size
extrapolation formulas. Finally, we investigate the system-size scaling of biases in diffusion
QMC.
