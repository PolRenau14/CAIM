Variability on external conditions has important consequences for the dynamics and the organization
of biological systems. In many cases, the characteristic timescale of environmental changes as
well as their correlations play a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to
it. A proper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires approaches
more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed further light onto this problem,
in this paper we propose a unifying framework based on different analytical and numerical tools
available to deal with "colored" environmental noise. In particular, we employ a "unified colored
noise approximation" to map the original problem into an effective one with white noise, and then
we apply a standard path integral approach to gain analytical understanding. For the sake of specificity,
we present our approach using as a guideline a variation of the contact process--which can also be
seen as a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst class--where the propagation or birth rate
varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle in a systematic manner some of the
relevant questions concerning population dynamics under environmental variability, such as
determining the stationary population density, establishing the conditions under which a population
may become extinct, and estimating extinction times. We focus on the emerging phase diagram and
its possible phase transitions, underlying how these are affected by the presence of environmental
noise time-correlations.
