We investigate the origin of the difference, which was noticed by Fey {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 104}, 145703 (2010)], between the steady state density of an Abelian sandpile model (ASM) and
the transition point of its corresponding deterministic fixed-energy sandpile model (DFES).
Being deterministic, the configuration space of a DFES can be divided into two disjoint classes
such that every configuration in one class should evolve into one of absorbing states, whereas no
configurations in the other class can reach an absorbing state. Since the two classes are separated
in terms of toppling dynamics, the system can be made to exhibit an absorbing phase transition (APT)
at various points that depend on the initial probability distribution of the configurations. Furthermore,
we show that in general the transition point also depends on whether an infinite-size limit is taken
before or after the infinite-time limit. To demonstrate, we numerically study the two-dimensional
DFES with Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld toppling rule (BTW-FES). We confirm that there are indeed many thresholds.
Nonetheless, the critical phenomena at various transition points are found to be universal. We
furthermore discuss a microscopic absorbing phase transition, or a so-called spreading dynamics,
of the BTW-FES, to find that the phase transition in this setting is related to the dynamical isotropic
percolation process rather than self-organized criticality. In particular, we argue that choosing
recurrent configurations of the corresponding ASM as an initial configuration does not allow for
a nontrivial APT in the DFES.
