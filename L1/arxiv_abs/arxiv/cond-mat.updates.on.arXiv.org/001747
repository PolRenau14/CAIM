Recent advances in scanning transmission electron and scanning probe microscopies have opened
exciting opportunities in probing the materials structural parameters and various functional
properties in real space with angstrom-level precision. This progress has been accompanied by
an exponential increase in the size and quality of datasets produced by microscopic and spectroscopic
experimental techniques. These developments necessitate adequate methods for extracting relevant
physical and chemical information from the large datasets, for which a priori information on the
structures of various atomic configurations and lattice defects is limited or absent. Here we demonstrate
an application of deep neural networks to extract information from atomically resolved images
including location of the atomic species and type of defects. We develop a 'weakly-supervised'
approach that uses information on the coordinates of all atomic species in the image, extracted
via a deep neural network, to identify a rich variety of defects that are not part of an initial training
set. We further apply our approach to interpret complex atomic and defect transformation, including
switching between different coordination of silicon dopants in graphene as a function of time,
formation of peculiar silicon dimer with mixed 3-fold and 4-fold coordination, and the motion of
molecular 'rotor'. This deep learning based approach resembles logic of a human operator, but can
be scaled leading to significant shift in the way of extracting and analyzing information from raw
experimental data.
