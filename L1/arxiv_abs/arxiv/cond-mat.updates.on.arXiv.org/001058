The local dynamics of the lead-free relaxor $0.964\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3-0.036\mathrm{BaTiO}_3$
(NBT-3.6BT) have been investigated by a combination of quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS)
and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In a previous paper, we were able to show that the tetragonal
platelets in the microstructure are crucial for understanding the dielectric properties of NBT-3.6BT
[F. Pforr et al., Phys. Rev. B 94, 014105 (2016)]. To investigate their dynamics, ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations were carried out using $\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$
with 001 cation order as a simple model system for the tetragonal platelets in NBT-3.6BT. Similarly,
111-ordered $\mathrm{Na}_{1/2}\mathrm{Bi}_{1/2}\mathrm{TiO}_3$ was used as a model for the
rhombohedral matrix. The measured single crystal QENS spectra could be reproduced by a linear combination
of calculated spectra. We find that the relaxational dynamics of NBT-3.6BT are concentrated in
the tetragonal platelets. Chaotic stages, during which the local tilt order changes incessantly
on the timescale of several picoseconds, cause the most significant contribution to the quasielastic
intensity. They can be regarded as an excited state of tetragonal platelets, whose relaxation back
into a quasistable state might explain the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties of
NBT-3.6BT in the 100 GHz to THz range. This substantiates the assumption that the relaxor properties
of NBT-3.6BT originate from the tetragonal platelets.
