Atom-probe tomography (APT) facilitates nano- and atomic-scale characterization and analysis
of microstructural features. Specifically, APT is well suited to study the interfacial properties
of granular or heterophase systems. Traditionally, the identification of the interface between,
for precipitate and matrix phases, in APT data has been obtained either by extracting iso-concentration
surfaces based on a user-supplied concentration value or by manually perturbing the concentration
value until the iso-concentration surface qualitatively matches the interface. These approaches
are subjective, not scalable, and may lead to inconsistencies due to local composition inhomogeneities.
We propose a digital image segmentation approach based on deep neural networks that transfer learned
knowledge from natural images to automatically segment the data obtained from APT into different
phases. This approach not only provides an efficient way to segment the data and extract interfacial
properties but does so without the need for expensive interface labeling for training the segmentation
model. We consider here a system with a precipitate phase in a matrix and with three different interface
modalities---layered, isolated, and interconnected---that are obtained for different relative
geometries of the precipitate phase. We demonstrate the accuracy of our segmentation approach
through qualitative visualization of the interfaces, as well as through quantitative comparisons
with proximity histograms obtained by using more traditional approaches.
