Distributed storage systems need to store data redundantly in order to provide some fault-tolerance
and guarantee system reliability. Different coding techniques have been proposed to provide the
required redundancy more efficiently than traditional replication schemes. However, compared
to replication, coding techniques are less efficient for repairing lost redundancy, as they require
retrieval of larger amounts of data from larger subsets of storage nodes. To mitigate these problems,
several recent works have presented locally repairable codes designed to minimize the repair traffic
and the number of nodes involved per repair. Unfortunately, existing methods often lead to codes
where there is only one subset of nodes able to repair a piece of lost data, limiting the local repairability
to the availability of the nodes in this subset. In this paper, we present a new family of locally repairable
codes that allows different trade-offs between the number of contacted nodes per repair, and the
number of different subsets of nodes that enable this repair. We show that slightly increasing the
number of contacted nodes per repair allows to have repair alternatives, which in turn increases
the probability of being able to perform efficient repairs. Finally, we present pg-BLRC, an explicit
construction of locally repairable codes with multiple repair alternatives, constructed from
partial geometries, in particular from Generalized Quadrangles. We show how these codes can achieve
practical lengths and high rates, while requiring a small number of nodes per repair, and providing
multiple repair alternatives.
