A large-scale content-centric mobile ad hoc network employing subpacketization is studied in
which each mobile node having finite-size cache moves according to the reshuffling mobility model
and requests a content object from the library independently at random according to the Zipf popularity
distribution. Instead of assuming that one content object is transferred in a single time slot,
we consider a more challenging scenario where the size of each content object is considerably large
and thus only a subpacket of a file can be delivered during one time slot, which is motivated by a fast
mobility scenario. Under our mobility model, we consider a single-hop-based content delivery
and characterize the fundamental trade-offs between throughput and delay. The order-optimal
throughput-delay trade-off is analyzed by presenting the following two content reception strategies:
the sequential reception for uncoded caching and the random reception for maximum distance separable
(MDS)-coded caching. We also perform numerical evaluation to validate our analytical results.
In particular, we conduct performance comparisons between the uncoded caching and the MDS-coded
caching strategies by identifying the regimes in which the performance difference between the
two caching strategies becomes prominent with respect to system parameters such as the Zipf exponent
and the number of subpackets. In addition, we extend our study to the random walk mobility scenario
and show that our main results are essentially the same as those in the reshuffling mobility model.
