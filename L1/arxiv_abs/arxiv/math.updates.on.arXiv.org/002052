We analyze the achievable information rates (AIRs) for coded modulation schemes with QAM constellations
with both bit-wise and symbol-wise decoders, corresponding to the case where a binary code is used
in combination with a higher-order modulation using the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)
paradigm and to the case where a nonbinary code over a field matched to the constellation size is used,
respectively. In particular, we consider hard decision decoding, which is the preferable option
for fiber-optic communication systems where decoding complexity is a concern. Recently, Liga
\emph{et al.} analyzed the AIRs for bit-wise and symbol-wise decoders considering what the authors
called \emph{hard decision decoder} which, however, exploits \emph{soft information} of the
transition probabilities of discrete-input discrete-output channel resulting from the hard
detection. As such, the complexity of the decoder is essentially the same as the complexity of a soft
decision decoder. In this paper, we analyze instead the AIRs for the standard hard decision decoder,
commonly used in practice, where the decoding is based on the Hamming distance metric. We show that
if standard hard decision decoding is used, bit-wise decoders yield significantly higher AIRs
than symbol-wise decoders. As a result, contrary to the conclusion by Liga \emph{et al.}, binary
decoders together with the BICM paradigm are preferable for spectrally-efficient fiber-optic
systems. We also design binary and nonbinary staircase codes and show that, in agreement with the
AIRs, binary codes yield better performance.
