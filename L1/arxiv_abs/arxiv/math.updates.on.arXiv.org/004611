In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT)
network, where a UAV flies at a constant altitude in the sky to provide wireless energy supply for
a set of ground nodes with a linear topology. Our objective is to maximize the minimum received energy
among all ground nodes by optimizing the UAV's one-dimensional (1D) trajectory, subject to the
maximum UAV flying speed constraint. Different from previous works that only provided heuristic
and locally optimal solutions, this paper is the first work to present the globally optimal 1D UAV
trajectory solution to the considered min-energy maximization problem. Towards this end, we first
show that for any given speed-constrained UAV trajectory, we can always construct a maximum-speed
trajectory and a speed-free trajectory, such that their combination can achieve the same received
energy at all these ground nodes. Next, we transform the original UAV-speed-constrained trajectory
optimization problem into an equivalent UAV-speed-free problem, which is then optimally solved
via the Lagrange dual method. The obtained optimal 1D UAV trajectory solution follows the so-called
successive hover-and-fly (SHF) structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers at a finite number
of hovering points each for an optimized hovering duration, and flies among these hovering points
at the maximum speed. Numerical results show that our proposed optimal solution significantly
outperforms the benchmark schemes in prior works under different scenarios.
