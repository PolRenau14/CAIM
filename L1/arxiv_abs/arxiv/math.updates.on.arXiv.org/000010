We extend the concept that life is an informational phenomenon, at every level of organisation,
from molecules to the global ecological system. According to this thesis: (a) living is information
processing, in which memory is maintained by both molecular states and ecological states as well
as the more obvious nucleic acid coding; (b) this information processing has one overall function
- to perpetuate itself; and (c) the processing method is filtration (cognition) of, and synthesis
of, information at lower levels to appear at higher levels in complex systems (emergence). We show
how information patterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent
consequences, to result in `functional information'. This constructive process forms arbitrarily
large complexes of information, the combined effects of which include the functions of life. Molecules
and simple organisms have already been measured in terms of functional information content; we
show how quantification may be extended to each level of organisation up to the ecological. In terms
of a computer analogy, life is both the data and the program and its biochemical structure is the way
the information is embodied. This idea supports the seamless integration of life at all scales with
the physical universe. The innovation reported here is essentially to integrate these ideas, basing
information on the `general definition' of information, rather than simply the statistics of information,
thereby explaining how functional information operates throughout life.
