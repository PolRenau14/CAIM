Oblivious Transfer (OT) is a fundamental cryptographic protocol that finds a number of applications,
in particular, as an essential building block for two-party and multi-party computation. We construct
a round-optimal (2 rounds) universally composable (UC) protocol for oblivious transfer secure
against active adaptive adversaries from any OW-CPA secure public-key encryption scheme with
certain properties in the random oracle model (ROM). In terms of computation, our protocol only
requires the generation of a public/secret-key pair, two encryption operations and one decryption
operation, apart from a few calls to the random oracle. In~terms of communication, our protocol
only requires the transfer of one public-key, two ciphertexts, and three binary strings of roughly
the same size as the message. Next, we show how to instantiate our construction under the low noise
LPN, McEliece, QC-MDPC, LWE, and CDH assumptions. Our instantiations based on the low noise LPN,
McEliece, and QC-MDPC assumptions are the first UC-secure OT protocols based on coding assumptions
to achieve: 1) adaptive security, 2) optimal round complexity, 3) low communication and computational
complexities. Previous results in this setting only achieved static security and used costly cut-and-choose
techniques.Our instantiation based on CDH achieves adaptive security at the small cost of communicating
only two more group elements as compared to the gap-DH based Simplest OT protocol of Chou and Orlandi
(Latincrypt 15), which only achieves static security in the ROM.
