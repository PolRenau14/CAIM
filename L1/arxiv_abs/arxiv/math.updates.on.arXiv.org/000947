The semantics of determiner phrases, be they definite de- scriptions, indefinite descriptions
or quantified noun phrases, is often as- sumed to be a fully solved question: common nouns are properties,
and determiners are generalised quantifiers that apply to two predicates: the property corresponding
to the common noun and the one corresponding to the verb phrase. We first present a criticism of this
standard view. Firstly, the semantics of determiners does not follow the syntactical structure
of the sentence. Secondly the standard interpretation of the indefinite article cannot ac- count
for nominal sentences. Thirdly, the standard view misses the linguis- tic asymmetry between the
two properties of a generalised quantifier. In the sequel, we propose a treatment of determiners
and quantifiers as Hilbert terms in a richly typed system that we initially developed for lexical
semantics, using a many sorted logic for semantical representations. We present this semantical
framework called the Montagovian generative lexicon and show how these terms better match the syntactical
structure and avoid the aforementioned problems of the standard approach. Hilbert terms rather
differ from choice functions in that there is one polymorphic operator and not one operator per formula.
They also open an intriguing connection between the logic for meaning assembly, the typed lambda
calculus handling compositionality and the many-sorted logic for semantical representations.
Furthermore epsilon terms naturally introduce type-judgements and confirm the claim that type
judgment are a form of presupposition.
