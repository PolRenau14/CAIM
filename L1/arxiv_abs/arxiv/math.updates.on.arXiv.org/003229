This paper considers a Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, where the base
station (BS) with a large number of antennas communicates with a smaller number of users. The signals
are transmitted using frequency division duplex (FDD) mode. The problem of user scheduling with
reduced overhead of channel estimation in the uplink of Massive MIMO systems has been investigated.
We consider the COST 2100 channel model. In this paper, we first propose a new user selection algorithm
based on knowledge of the geometry of the service area and of location of clusters, without having
full channel state information (CSI) at the BS. We then show that the correlation in geometry-based
stochastic channel models (GSCMs) arises from the common clusters in the area. In addition, exploiting
the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB)s, the analysis for the robustness of the proposed
scheme to cluster position errors is presented. It is shown by analysing the capacity upper-bound
that the capacity strongly depends on the position of clusters in the GSCMs and users in the system.
Simulation results show that although the BS receiver does not require the channel information
of all users, by the proposed geometry-based user scheduling (GUS) algorithm the sum-rate of the
system is only slightly less than the well-known greedy weight clique (GWC) scheme \cite{SUSGoldsmithGlobcom,ITC09_Userselection_GWC}.
{Finally, the robustness of the proposed algorithm to cluster localization is verified by the simulation
results.
