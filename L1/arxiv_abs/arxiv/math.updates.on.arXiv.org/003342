Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) is subject to nonlinearity at the
energy harvester that leads to significant changes to transmit signal designs compared to conventional
wireless communications. In this paper, the capacity of a discrete time, memoryless and complex
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel in the presence of a nonlinear energy harvester at
the receiver is studied. Considering the two common nonlinear energy harvester models introduced
in the literature, two sets of constraints are considered. First the capacity is studied under average
power (AP), peak amplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP constraint
is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger
than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the
same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints,
it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under AP, PA and RDP constraints,
the amplitude of the optimal inputs is discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity
is studied under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled as satisfying
a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the received signal being outside of a given
interval. Similarly, it is shown that the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite
number of mass points.
