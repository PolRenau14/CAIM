This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless powered communication
network (WPCN) systems where a mobile access point (AP) at the UAV serves multiple energy-constrained
ground terminals (GTs). Specifically, the UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless
energy transfer (WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy
from the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) signals to the
UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the UAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely
integrated UAV and separated UAV WPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP
in which both energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV. In contrast,
for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which behaves as an energy AP and an information
AP independently, and thus the energy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed
at two different UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the UAVs, the uplink
power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET and the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput
of the GTs. Since the formulated problems are non-convex, we apply the concave-convex procedure
by deriving appropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints. As a result, we propose iterative
algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for the minimum throughput maximization
problems. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional
schemes.
