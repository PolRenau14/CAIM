Spectrum pooling allows multiple operators, or tenants, to share the same frequency bands. This
work studies the optimization of spectrum pooling for the downlink of a multi-tenant Cloud Radio
Access Network (C-RAN) system in the presence of inter-tenant privacy constraints. The spectrum
available for downlink transmission is partitioned into private and shared subbands, and the participating
operators cooperate to serve the user equipments (UEs) on the shared subband. The network of each
operator consists of a cloud processor (CP) that is connected to proprietary radio units (RUs) by
means of finite-capacity fronthaul links. In order to enable interoperator cooperation, the CPs
of the participating operators are also connected by finite-capacity backhaul links. Inter-operator
cooperation may hence result in loss of privacy. Fronthaul and backhaul links are used to transfer
quantized baseband signals. Standard quantization is considered first. Then, a novel approach
based on the idea of correlating quantization noise signals across RUs of different operators is
proposed to control the trade-off between distortion at UEs and inter-operator privacy. The problem
of optimizing the bandwidth allocation, precoding, and fronthaul/backhaul compression strategies
is tackled under constraints on backhaul and fronthaul capacity, as well as on per-RU transmit power
and inter-operator privacy. For both cases, the optimization problems are tackled using the concave
convex procedure (CCCP), and extensive numerical results are provided.
