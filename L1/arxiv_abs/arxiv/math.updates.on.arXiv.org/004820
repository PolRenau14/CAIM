In a distributed computing system for the master-worker framework, an erasure code can mitigate
the effects of slow workers, also called stragglers. The distributed computing system combined
with coding is referred to as coded computation. We introduce a variation of coded computation that
protects the master's privacy from the workers, which is referred to as private coded computation.
In private coded computation, the master needs to compute a function of its own dataset and one of
the datasets in a library exclusively shared by the external workers. After the master recovers
the result of the desired function through coded computation, the workers should not know which
dataset in the library was desired by the master, which implies that the master's privacy is protected.
We propose a private coded computation scheme for matrix multiplication, namely private polynomial
codes, based on polynomial codes for conventional coded computation. As special cases of private
polynomial codes, we propose private one-shot polynomial codes and private asynchronous polynomial
codes. Whereas the private one-shot polynomial code achieves a lower communication load from the
master to each worker, the private asynchronous polynomial code achieves faster computation than
private one-shot polynomial codes. In terms of computation time and communication load, we compare
private one-shot polynomial codes and private asynchronous polynomial codes with a conventional
robust private information retrieval scheme which can be directly applied to coded computation.
