Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a popular approach to study marginalized or hard-to-reach
populations. It collects samples from a networked population by incentivizing participants to
refer their friends into the study. One major challenge in analyzing RDS samples is seed bias. Seed
bias refers to the fact that when the social network is divided into multiple communities (or blocks),
the RDS sample might not provide a balanced representation of the different communities in the population,
and such unbalance is correlated with the initial participant (or the seed). In this case, the distributions
of estimators are typically non-trivial mixtures, which are determined (1) by the seed and (2) by
how the referrals transition from one block to another. This paper shows that (1) block-transition
probabilities are easy to estimate with high accuracy, and (2) we can use these estimated block-transition
probabilities to estimate the stationary distribution over blocks and thus, an estimate of the
block proportions. This stationary distribution on blocks has previously been used in the RDS literature
to evaluate whether the sampling process has appeared to `mix'. We use these estimated block proportions
in a simple post-stratified (PS) estimator that greatly diminishes seed bias. By aggregating over
the blocks/strata in this way, we prove that the PS estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent under a Markov
model, even when other estimators are not. Simulations show that the PS estimator has smaller Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the state-of-the-art estimators.
