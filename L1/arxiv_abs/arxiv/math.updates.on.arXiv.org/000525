We derive new diffusion solutions to the monoenergetic generalized linear Boltzmann transport
equation (GLBE) for the stationary collision density and scalar flux about an isotropic point source
in an infinite $d$-dimensional absorbing medium with isotropic scattering. We consider both classical
transport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary dimensions as well as
a number of non-classical transport theories (non-exponential random flights) that describe
a broader class of transport processes within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous
asymptotic diffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize Grosjean's
moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or uncollided) distribution from the collided
portion and approximating only the latter using diffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension
and for many free-path distributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations
that are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small source-detector separations
than either $P_1$ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic diffusion. These diffusion-based approximations
are exact in the first two even spatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical
transport types. We also discuss connections between the random-flight-theory derivation of
the Green's function and the discrete spectrum of the transport operator and report some new observations
regarding the discrete eigenvalues of the transport operator for general dimensions and free-path
distributions.
