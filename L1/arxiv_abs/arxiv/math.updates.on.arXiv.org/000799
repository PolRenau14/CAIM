When a blood vessel ruptures or gets inflamed, the human body responds by rapidly forming a clot to
restrict the loss of blood. Platelets aggregation at the injury site of the blood vessel occurring
via platelet-platelet adhesion, tethering and rolling on the injured endothelium is a critical
initial step in blood clot formation. A novel three-dimensional multiscale model is introduced
and used in this paper to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable platelets at the site
of vascular injury under different shear rates of blood flow. The novelty of the model is based on
a new approach of coupling submodels at three biological scales crucial for the early clot formation:
novel hybrid cell membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a platelet,
stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell adhesion kinetics and Lattice Boltzmann
submodel for simulating blood flow. The model implementation on the GPUs cluster significantly
improved simulation performance. Predictive model simulations revealed that platelet deformation,
interactions between platelets in the vicinity of the vessel wall as well as the number of functional
GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors played significant roles in the platelet adhesion to the injury
site. Variation of the number of functional GPIb{\alpha} platelet receptors as well as changes
of platelet stiffness can represent effects of specific drugs reducing or enhancing platelet activity.
Therefore, predictive simulations can improve the search for new drug targets and help to make treatment
of thrombosis patient specific.
