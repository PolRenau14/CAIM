The emergence of novel interactive multimedia applications with high rate and low latency requirements
has led to a drastic increase in the video data traffic over wireless cellular networks. Endowing
the small base stations of a macro-cell with caches that can store some of the content is a promising
technology to cope with the increasing pressure on the backhaul connections, and to reduce the delay
for demanding video applications. In this work, delivery of an interactive multiview video to a
set of wireless users is studied in an heterogeneous cellular network. Differently from existing
works that focus on the optimization of the delivery delay and ignore the video characteristics,
the caching and scheduling policies are jointly optimized, taking into account the quality of the
delivered video and the video delivery time constraints. We formulate our joint caching and scheduling
problem as the average expected video distortion minimization, and show that this problem is NP-hard.
We then provide an equivalent formulation based on submodular set function maximization and propose
a greedy solution with $\frac{1}{2}(1-\mbox{e}^{-1})$ approximation guarantee. The evaluation
of the proposed joint caching and scheduling policy shows that it significantly outperforms benchmark
algorithms based on popularity caching and independent scheduling. Another important contribution
of this paper is a new constant approximation ratio for the greedy submodular set function maximization
subject to a $d$-dimensional knapsack constraint.
