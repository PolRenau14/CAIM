Covert communication conceals the transmission of the message from an attentive adversary. Recent
work on the limits of covert communication in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels has
demonstrated that a covert transmitter (Alice) can reliably transmit a maximum of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$
bits to a covert receiver (Bob) without being detected by an adversary (Warden Willie) in $n$ channel
uses. This paper focuses on the scenario where other friendly nodes distributed according to a two-dimensional
Poisson point process with density $m$ are present in the environment. We propose a strategy where
the friendly node closest to the adversary, without close coordination with Alice, produces artificial
noise. We show that this method allows Alice to reliably and covertly send $\mathcal{O}(\min\{{n,m^{\gamma/2}\sqrt{n}}\})$
bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses, where $\gamma$ is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, we also consider
a setting where there are $N_{\mathrm{w}}$ collaborating adversaries uniformly and randomly
located in the environment and show that in $n$ channel uses, Alice can reliably and covertly send
$\mathcal{O}\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{m^{\gamma/2} \sqrt{n}}{N_{\mathrm{w}}^{\gamma}}\right\}\right)$
bits to Bob when $\gamma >2$, and $\mathcal{O}\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{N_{\mathrm{w}}^{2}\log^2
{N_{\mathrm{w}}}}\right\}\right)$ when $\gamma = 2$. Conversely, under mild restrictions on
the communication strategy, we demonstrate that no higher covert throughput is possible for $\gamma>2$.
