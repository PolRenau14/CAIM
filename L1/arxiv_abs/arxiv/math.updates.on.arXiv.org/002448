Next-generation wireless networks will provide users ubiquitous low-latency computing services
using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC,
mobile computation offloading (MCO), is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since
each edge device comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), a MEC network can be decomposed
as a radio access network (RAN) cascaded with a CS network (CSN). Based on the architecture, we investigate
network constrained latency performance, namely communication latency (comm-latency) and computation
latency (comp-latency) under the constraints of RAN coverage and CSN stability. To this end, a spatial
random network is modeled featuring random node distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal
multiple access, and random computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network
constraints, we derive the scaling laws of comm-latency and comp-latency with respect to network-load
parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates) and network-resource parameters
(bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, CS computation rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the
interplay of theories of stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the
derived scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network coverage and network
stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network provisioning and planning by
avoiding either of the cascaded RAN or CSN being a performance bottleneck.
