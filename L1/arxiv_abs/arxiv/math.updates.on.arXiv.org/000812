In order to obtain the best-known guarantees, algorithms are traditionally tailored to the particular
problem we want to solve. Two recent developments, the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and the Sum-of-Squares
(SOS) method, surprisingly suggest that this tailoring is not necessary and that a single efficient
algorithm could achieve best possible guarantees for a wide range of different problems. The Unique
Games Conjecture (UGC) is a tantalizing conjecture in computational complexity, which, if true,
will shed light on the complexity of a great many problems. In particular this conjecture predicts
that a single concrete algorithm provides optimal guarantees among all efficient algorithms for
a large class of computational problems. The Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method is a general approach
for solving systems of polynomial constraints. This approach is studied in several scientific
disciplines, including real algebraic geometry, proof complexity, control theory, and mathematical
programming, and has found applications in fields as diverse as quantum information theory, formal
verification, game theory and many others. We survey some connections that were recently uncovered
between the Unique Games Conjecture and the Sum-of-Squares method. In particular, we discuss new
tools to rigorously bound the running time of the SOS method for obtaining approximate solutions
to hard optimization problems, and how these tools give the potential for the sum-of-squares method
to provide new guarantees for many problems of interest, and possibly to even refute the UGC.
