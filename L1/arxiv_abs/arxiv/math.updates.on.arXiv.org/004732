We resume the investigation of the problem of independent local compression of correlated quantum
sources, the classical case of which is covered by the celebrated Slepian-Wolf theorem. We focus
specifically on classical-quantum (cq) sources, for which one edge of the rate region, corresponding
to the compression of the classical part, using the quantum part as side information at the decoder,
was previously determined by Devetak and Winter [Phys. Rev. A 68, 042301 (2003)]. Whereas the Devetak-Winter
protocol attains a rate-sum equal to the von Neumann entropy of the joint source, here we show that
the full rate region is much more complex, due to the partially quantum nature of the source. In particular,
in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part of the source, using the classical part as side
information at the decoder, typically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy
of the total source. We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart from
the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a rate sum strictly larger
than the joint entropy. We can interpret the difference as the price paid for the quantum encoder
being ignorant of the classical side information. In the general case, we give an achievable rate
region, via protocols that are built on the decoupling principle, and the principles of quantum
state merging and quantum state redistribution. Our achievable region is matched almost by a single-letter
converse, which however still involves asymptotic errors and an unbounded auxiliary system.
