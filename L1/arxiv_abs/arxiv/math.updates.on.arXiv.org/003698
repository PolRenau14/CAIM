Natural selection explains how life has evolved over millions of years from more primitive forms.
The speed at which this happens, however, has sometimes defied formal explanations when based on
random (uniformly distributed) mutations. Here we investigate the application of a simplicity
bias based on a natural but algorithmic distribution of mutations (no recombination) in various
examples, particularly binary matrices in order to compare evolutionary convergence rates. Results
both on synthetic and on small biological examples indicate an accelerated rate when mutations
are not statistical uniform but \textit{algorithmic uniform}. We show that algorithmic distributions
can evolve modularity and genetic memory by preservation of structures when they first occur sometimes
leading to an accelerated production of diversity but also population extinctions, possibly explaining
naturally occurring phenomena such as diversity explosions (e.g. the Cambrian) and massive extinctions
(e.g. the End Triassic) whose causes are currently a cause for debate. The natural approach introduced
here appears to be a better approximation to biological evolution than models based exclusively
upon random uniform mutations, and it also approaches a formal version of open-ended evolution
based on previous formal results. These results validate some suggestions in the direction that
computation may be an equally important driver of evolution. We also show that inducing the method
on problems of optimization, such as genetic algorithms, has the potential to accelerate convergence
of artificial evolutionary algorithms.
