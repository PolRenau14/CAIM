Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) systems offer a flexibility of filtering arbitrary number
of subcarriers to suppress out of band (OoB) emission, while keeping the orthogonality between
subbands and subcarriers within one subband. However, subband filtering may affect system performance
and capacity in a number of ways. In this paper, we first propose the conditions for interference-free
one-tap equalization and corresponding signal model in the frequency domain for multi-user (MU)
UFMC system. Based on this ideal interference-free case, impact of subband filtering on the system
performance is analyzed in terms of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per subband, capacity
per subcarrier and bit error rate (BER) and compared with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) system. This is followed by filter length selection strategies to provide guidelines for
system design. Next, by taking carrier frequency offset (CFO), timing offset (TO), insufficient
guard interval between symbols and filter tail cutting (TC) into consideration, an analytical
system model is established. New channel equalization algorithms are proposed by considering
the errors and imperfections based on the derived signal models. In addition, a set of optimization
criteria in terms of filter length and guard interval/filter TC length subject to various constraints
is formulated to maximize the system capacity. Numerical results show that the analytical and corresponding
optimal approaches match the simulation results, and the proposed equalization algorithms can
significantly improve the BER performance.
