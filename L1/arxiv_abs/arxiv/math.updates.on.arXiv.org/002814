Providing secure communications over the physical layer has been receiving growing attention
within the past decade. The vast majority of the existing studies in the area of physical layer security
focus exclusively on the scenarios where the channel inputs are Gaussian distributed. However,
in practice, the signals employed for transmission are drawn from discrete signal constellations
such as phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. Hence, understanding the impact
of the finite-alphabet input constraints and designing secure transmission schemes under this
assumption is a mandatory step towards a practical implementation of physical layer security.
With this motivation, this article reviews recent developments on physical layer security with
finite-alphabet inputs. We explore transmit signal design algorithms for single-antenna as well
as multi-antenna wiretap channels under different assumptions on the channel state information
at the transmitter. Moreover, we present a review of the recent results on secure transmission with
discrete signaling for various scenarios including multi-carrier transmission systems, broadcast
channels with confidential messages, cognitive multiple access and relay networks. Throughout
the article, we stress the important behavioral differences of discrete and Gaussian inputs in
the context of the physical layer security. We also present an overview of the practical code construction
over Gaussian and fading wiretap channels, and we discuss some open problems and directions for
future research.
