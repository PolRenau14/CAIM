We study the problem of testing, using only a single sample, between mean field distributions (like
Curie-Weiss, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi) and structured Gibbs distributions (like Ising model on sparse
graphs and Exponential Random Graphs). Our goal is to test without knowing the parameter values
of the underlying models: only the \emph{structure} of dependencies is known. We develop a new approach
that applies to both the Ising and Exponential Random Graph settings based on a general and natural
statistical test. The test can distinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain
threshold in the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the threshold no
test can distinguish the hypotheses. The thresholds do not correspond to the presence of long-range
order in the models. By aggregating information at a global scale, our test works even at very high
temperatures. The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration of
quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary,
since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the temperature
parameter. At the same time, this restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under
consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent setting; this makes
it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein's method) for concentration of weakly dependent
variables. Instead, we carry out an additional tensorization argument using a Markov chain that
respects the symmetry of the Hamming sphere.
