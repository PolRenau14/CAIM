In this paper, a software-based simulator for the deployment of base station-equipped unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a cellular network is proposed. To this end, the Google Earth Engine platform
and its included image processing functions are used to collect geospatial data and to identify
obstacles that can disrupt the line-of-sight (LoS) communications between UAVs and ground users.
Given such geographical information, three environment-aware optimal UAV deployment scenarios
are investigated using the developed simulator. In the first scenario, the positions of UAVs are
optimized such that the number of ground users covered by UAVs is maximized. In the second scenario,
the minimum number of UAVs needed to provide full coverage for all ground users is determined. Finally,
given the load requirements of the ground users, the total flight time (i.e., energy) that the UAVs
need to completely serve the ground users is minimized. Simulation results using a real area of the
Virginia Tech campus show that the proposed environment-aware drone deployment framework with
Google Earth input significantly enhances the network performance in terms of coverage and energy
consumption, compared to classical deployment approaches that do not exploit geographical information.
In particular, the results show that the proposed approach yields a coverage enhancement by a factor
of 2, and a 65% improvement in energy-efficiency. The results have also shown the existence of an
optimal number of drones that leads to a maximum wireless coverage performance.
