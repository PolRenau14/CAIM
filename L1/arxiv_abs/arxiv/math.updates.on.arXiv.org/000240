In this paper, we address the problem of orientation that naturally arises when representing shapes
like curves or surfaces as currents. In the field of computational anatomy, the framework of currents
has indeed proved very efficient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches,
orientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks in treating certain
kind of datasets. More specifically, problems occur with structures like acute pikes because of
canceling effects of currents or with data that consists in many disconnected pieces like fiber
bundles for which currents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising alternative
to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric measure theory by F. Almgren, allow
the representation of any non-oriented manifold (more generally any non-oriented rectifiable
set). In particular, we explain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both
from the discrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert space structure
on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing kernels. We show that, unlike the currents'
setting, these metrics are consistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for
the variation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2). Finally, we propose a generalization
to non-oriented shapes of registration algorithms in the context of Large Deformations Metric
Mapping (LDDMM), which we detail with a few examples in the last part of the paper.
