Intelligent mobile platforms such as smart vehicles and drones have recently become the focus of
attention for onboard deployment of machine learning mechanisms to enable low latency decisions
with low risk of privacy breach. However, most such machine learning algorithms are both computation-and-memory
intensive, which makes it highly difficult to implement the requisite computations on a single
device of limited computation, memory, and energy resources. Wireless distributed computing
presents new opportunities by pooling the computation and storage resources among devices. For
low-latency applications, the key bottleneck lies in the exchange of intermediate results among
mobile devices for data shuffling. To improve communication efficiency, we propose a co-channel
communication model and design transceivers by exploiting the locally computed intermediate
values as side information. A low-rank optimization model is proposed to maximize the achieved
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) by establishing the interference alignment condition for data shuffling.
Unfortunately, existing approaches to approximate the rank function fail to yield satisfactory
performance due to the poor structure in the formulated low-rank optimization problem. In this
paper, we develop an efficient DC algorithm to solve the presented low-rank optimization problem
by proposing a novel DC representation for the rank function. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that the proposed DC approach can significantly improve the communication efficiency whereas
the achievable DoF almost remains unchanged when the number of mobile devices grows.
