In this paper we present matrix game-theoretic models for joint routing, network coding, and scheduling
problem. First routing and network coding are modeled by using a new approach based on compressed
topology matrix that takes into account the inherent multicast gain of the network. The scheduling
is optimized by a new approach called network graph soft coloring. Soft graph coloring is designed
by switching between different components of a wireless network graph, which we refer to as graph
fractals, with appropriate usage rates. The network components, represented by graph fractals,
are a new paradigm in network graph partitioning that enables modeling of the network optimization
problem by using the matrix game framework. In the proposed game which is a nonlinear cubic game,
the strategy sets of the players are links, path, and network components. The outputs of this game
model are mixed strategy vectors of the second and the third players at equilibrium. Strategy vector
of the second player specifies optimum multi-path routing and network coding solution while mixed
strategy vector of the third players indicates optimum switching rate among different network
components or membership probabilities for optimal soft scheduling approach. Optimum throughput
is the value of the proposed nonlinear cubic game at equilibrium. The proposed nonlinear cubic game
is solved by extending fictitious playing method. Numerical and simulation results prove the superior
performance of the proposed techniques compared to the conventional schemes using hard graph coloring.
