In this paper, we investigate the problem of beam alignment in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems,
and design an optimal algorithm to reduce the overhead. Specifically, due to directional communications,
the transmitter and receiver beams need to be aligned, which incurs high delay overhead since without
a priori knowledge of the transmitter/receiver location, the search space spans the entire angular
domain. This is further exacerbated under dynamic conditions (e.g., moving vehicles) where the
access to the base station (access point) is highly dynamic with intermittent on-off periods, requiring
more frequent beam alignment and signal training. To mitigate this issue, we consider an online
stochastic optimization formulation where the goal is to maximize the directivity gain (i.e.,
received energy) of the beam alignment policy within a time period. We exploit the inherent correlation
and unimodality properties of the model, and demonstrate that contextual information improves
the performance. To this end, we propose an equivalent structured Multi-Armed Bandit model to optimally
exploit the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In contrast to the classical MAB models, the contextual
information makes the lower bound on regret (i.e., performance loss compared with an oracle policy)
independent of the number of beams. This is a crucial property since the number of all combinations
of beam patterns can be large in transceiver antenna arrays, especially in massive MIMO systems.
We further provide an asymptotically optimal beam alignment algorithm, and investigate its performance
via simulations.
