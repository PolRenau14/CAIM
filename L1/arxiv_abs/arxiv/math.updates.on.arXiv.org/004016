We present two results on slime mold computations. In wet-lab experiments (Nature'00) by Nakagaki
et al. the slime mold Physarum polycephalum demonstrated its ability to solve shortest path problems.
Biologists proposed a mathematical model, a system of differential equations, for the slime's
adaption process (J. Theoretical Biology'07). It was shown that the process convergences to the
shortest path (J. Theoretical Biology'12) for all graphs. We show that the dynamics actually converges
for a much wider class of problems, namely undirected linear programs with a non-negative cost vector.
Combinatorial optimization researchers took the dynamics describing slime behavior as an inspiration
for an optimization method and showed that its discretization can $\varepsilon$-approximately
solve linear programs with positive cost vector (ITCS'16). Their analysis requires a feasible
starting point, a step size depending linearly on $\varepsilon$, and a number of steps with quartic
dependence on $\mathrm{opt}/(\varepsilon\Phi)$, where $\Phi$ is the difference between the
smallest cost of a non-optimal basic feasible solution and the optimal cost ($\mathrm{opt}$).
We give a refined analysis showing that the dynamics initialized with any strongly dominating point
converges to the set of optimal solutions. Moreover, we strengthen the convergence rate bounds
and prove that the step size is independent of $\varepsilon$, and the number of steps depends logarithmically
on $1/\varepsilon$ and quadratically on $\mathrm{opt}/\Phi$.
