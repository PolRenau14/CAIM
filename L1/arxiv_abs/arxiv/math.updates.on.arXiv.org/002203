We consider the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink, where a very
large number of distributed multiple-antenna access points (APs) serve many single-antenna users
in the same time-frequency resource. A simple (distributed) conjugate beamforming scheme is applied
at each AP via the use of local channel state information (CSI). This CSI is acquired through time-division
duplex operation and the reception of uplink training signals transmitted by the users. We derive
a closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency taking into account the effects of channel
estimation errors and power control. This closed-form result enables us to analyze the effects
of backhaul power consumption, the number of APs, and the number of antennas per AP on the total energy
efficiency, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation algorithm. The optimal power allocation
algorithm aims at maximizing the total energy efficiency, subject to a per-user spectral efficiency
constraint and a per-AP power constraint. Compared with the equal power control, our proposed power
allocation scheme can double the total energy efficiency. Furthermore, we propose AP selections
schemes, in which each user chooses a subset of APs, to reduce the power consumption caused by the
backhaul links. With our proposed AP selection schemes, the total energy efficiency increases
significantly, especially for large numbers of APs. Moreover, under a requirement of good quality-of-service
for all users, cell-free massive MIMO outperforms the colocated counterpart in terms of energy
efficiency.
