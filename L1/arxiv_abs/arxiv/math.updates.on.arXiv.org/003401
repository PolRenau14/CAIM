A new circularly pulse-shaped (CPS) precoding orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveform, or CPS-OFDM for short, is proposed in this paper. CPS-OFDM, characterized by user-specific
precoder flexibility, possesses the advantages of both low out-of-subband emission (OSBE) and
low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which are two major desired physical layer signal properties
for various scenarios in 5G New Radio (NR), including fragmented spectrum access, new types of user
equipments (UEs), and communications at high carrier frequencies. As opposed to most of existing
waveform candidates using windowing or filtering techniques, CPS-OFDM prevents block extension
that causes extra inter-block interference (IBI) and envelope fluctuation unfriendly to signal
reception and power amplifier (PA) efficiency, respectively. An optimization problem of the prototype
shaping vector built in the CPS precoder is formulated to minimize the variance of instantaneous
power (VIP) with controllable OSBE power (OSBEP) and noise enhancement penalty (NEP). In order
to solve the optimization problem involving a quartic objective function, the majorization-minimization
(MM) algorithmic framework is exploited. By proving the convexity of the proposed problem, the
globally optimal solution invariant of coming data is guaranteed to be attained via numbers of iterations.
Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of detection reliability
and spectral efficiency for practical 5G cases such as asynchronous transmissions and mixed numerologies.
