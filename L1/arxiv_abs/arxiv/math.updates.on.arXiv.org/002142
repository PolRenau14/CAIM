An energy-limited source trying to transmit multiple packets to a destination with possibly different
sizes is considered. With limited energy, the source cannot potentially transmit all bits of all
packets. In addition, there is a delay cost associated with each packet. Thus, the source has to choose,
how many bits to transmit for each packet, and the order in which to transmit these bits, to minimize
the cost of distortion (introduced by transmitting lower number of bits) and queueing plus transmission
delay, across all packets. Assuming an exponential metric for distortion loss and linear delay
cost, we show that the optimization problem is jointly convex. Hence, the problem can be exactly
solved using convex solvers, however, because of the complicated expression derived from the KKT
conditions, no closed form solution can be found even with the simplest cost function choice made
in the paper, also the optimal order in which packets should be transmitted needs to be found via brute
force. To facilitate a more structured solution, a discretized version of the problem is also considered,
where time and energy are divided in discrete amounts. In any time slot (fixed length), bits belonging
to any one packet can be transmitted, while any discrete number of energy quanta can be used in any
slot corresponding to any one packet, such that the total energy constraint is satisfied. The discretized
problem is a special case of a multi-partitioning problem, where each packet's utility is super-modular
and the proposed greedy solution is shown to incur cost that is at most $2$-times of the optimal cost.
