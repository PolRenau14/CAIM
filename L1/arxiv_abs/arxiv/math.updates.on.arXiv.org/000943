Radio-frequency (RF) impairments in the transceiver hardware of communication systems (e.g.,
phase noise (PN), high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities, or in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q)
imbalance) can severely degrade the performance of traditional multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. Although calibration algorithms can partially compensate these impairments,
the remaining distortion still has substantial impact. Despite this, most prior works have not
analyzed this type of distortion. In this paper, we investigate the impact of residual transceiver
hardware impairments on the MIMO system performance. In particular, we consider a transceiver
impairment model, which has been experimentally validated, and derive analytical ergodic capacity
expressions for both exact and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We demonstrate that the capacity
saturates in the high-SNR regime, thereby creating a finite capacity ceiling. We also present a
linear approximation for the ergodic capacity in the low-SNR regime, and show that impairments
have only a second-order impact on the capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of transceiver
impairments on large-scale MIMO systems; interestingly, we prove that if one increases the number
of antennas at one side only, the capacity behaves similar to the finite-dimensional case. On the
contrary, if the number of antennas on both sides increases with a fixed ratio, the capacity ceiling
vanishes; thus, impairments cause only a bounded offset in the capacity compared to the ideal transceiver
hardware case.
