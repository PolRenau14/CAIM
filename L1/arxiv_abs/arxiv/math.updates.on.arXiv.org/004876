Millimeter-wave will be a key technology in next-generation wireless networks thanks to abundant
bandwidth availability. However, the use of large antenna arrays with beamforming demands precise
beam-alignment between transmitter and receiver, and may entail huge overhead in mobile environments.
This paper investigates the design of an optimal interactive beam-alignment and data communication
protocol, with the goal of minimizing power consumption under a minimum rate constraint. The base-station
selects beam-alignment or data communication and the beam parameters, based on feedback from the
user-end. Based on the sectored antenna model and uniform prior on the angles of departure and arrival
(AoD/AoA), the optimality of a fixed-length beam-alignment phase followed by a data-communication
phase is demonstrated. Moreover, a decoupled fractional beam-alignment method is shown to be optimal,
which decouples over time the alignment of AoD and AoA, and iteratively scans a fraction of their
region of uncertainty. A heuristic policy is proposed for non-uniform prior on AoD/AoA, with provable
performance guarantees, and it is shown that the uniform prior is the worst-case scenario. The performance
degradation due to detection errors is studied analytically and via simulation. The numerical
results with analog beams depict up to 4dB, 7.5dB, and 14 dB gains over a state-of-the-art bisection
method, conventional and interactive exhaustive search policies, respectively, and demonstrate
that the sectored model provides valuable insights for beam-alignment design.
