Near the beginning of the century, Wright and Fisher devised an elegant, mathematically tractable
model of gene reproduction and replacement that laid the foundation for contemporary population
genetics. The Wright-Fisher model and its extensions have given biologists powerful tools of statistical
inference that enabled the quantification of genetic drift and selection. Given the utility of
these tools, we often forget that their model - for mathematical, and not biological reasons - makes
assumptions that are violated in most real-world populations. In this paper, I consider an alternative
framework that merges P. A. P. Moran's continuous-time Markov chain model of allele frequency with
the density dependent models of ecological competition proposed by Gause, Lotka and Volterra,
that, unlike Moran's model allow for a stochastically varying -- but bounded -- population size.
I require that allele numbers vary according to a density-dependent population process, for which
the limiting law of large numbers is a dissipative, irreducible, competitive dynamical system.
Under the assumption that this limiting system admits a codimension one submanifold of attractive
fixed points -- a condition that naturally generalises the weak selection regime of classical population
dynamics -- it is shown that for an appropriate rescaling of time, the finite dimensional distributions
of the original process converge to those of a diffusion process on the submanifold. Weak convergence
results are also obtained for a related process.
