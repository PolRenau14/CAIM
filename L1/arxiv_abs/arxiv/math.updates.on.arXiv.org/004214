In the traditional index coding problem, a server employs coding to send messages to $n$ clients
within the same broadcast domain. Each client already has some messages as side information and
requests a particular unknown message from the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that
they can decode and retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation is that, learning the
coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer information about the requests
and side information of other clients. In this paper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing
each client to have limited access to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices
so that each client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her requested message.
By means of two different privacy metrics, we first show that this approach indeed increases the
level of privacy. Based on this, we propose the use of $k$-limited-access schemes: given an index
coding scheme that employs $T$ transmissions, we create a $k$-limited-access scheme with $T_k\geq
T$ transmissions, and with the property that each client needs at most $k$ transmissions to decode
her message. We derive upper and lower bounds on $T_k$ for all values of $k$, and develop deterministic
designs for these schemes, which are universal, i.e., independent of the coding matrix. We show
that our schemes are order-optimal when either $k$ or $n$ is large. Moreover, we propose heuristics
that complement the universal schemes for the case when both $n$ and $k$ are small.
