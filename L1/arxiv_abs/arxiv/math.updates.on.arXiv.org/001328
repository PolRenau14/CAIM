In recent years, the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) has gained popularity as a method for the
analysis of signals that can be broken down into multiple components determined by instantaneous
amplitudes and phases. One such version of SST, based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT),
enables the sharpening of instantaneous frequency (IF) information derived from the STFT, as well
as the separation of amplitude-phase components corresponding to distinct IF curves. However,
this SST is limited by the time-frequency resolution of the underlying window function, and may
not resolve signals exhibiting diverse time-frequency behaviors with sufficient accuracy. In
this work, we develop a framework for an SST based on a "quilted" short-time Fourier transform (SST-QSTFT),
which allows adaptation to signal behavior in separate time-frequency regions through the use
of multiple windows. This motivates us to introduce a discrete reassignment frequency formula
based on a finite difference of the phase spectrum, ensuring computational accuracy for a wider
variety of windows. We develop a theoretical framework for the SST-QSTFT in both the continuous
and the discrete settings, and describe an algorithm for the automatic selection of optimal windows
depending on the region of interest. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the superior numerical
performance of SST-QSTFT relative to other SST methods in a noisy context. Finally, we apply SST-QSTFT
to audio recordings of animal calls to demonstrate the potential of our method for the analysis of
real bioacoustic signals.
