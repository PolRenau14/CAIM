An important but missing component in the application of the kernel independent fast multipole
method (KIFMM) is the capability for flexibly and efficiently imposing singly, doubly, and triply
periodic boundary conditions. In most popular packages such periodicities are imposed with the
hierarchical repetition of periodic boxes, which may give an incorrect answer due to the conditional
convergence of some kernel sums. Here we present an efficient method to properly impose periodic
boundary conditions using a near-far splitting scheme. The near-field contribution is directly
calculated with the KIFMM method, while the far-field contribution is calculated with a multipole-to-local
(M2L) operator which is independent of the source and target point distribution. The M2L operator
is constructed with the far-field portion of the kernel function to generate the far-field contribution
with the downward equivalent source points in KIFMM. This method guarantees the sum of the near-field
\& far-field converge pointwise to results satisfying periodicity and compatibility conditions.
The computational cost of the far-field calculation observes the same $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity
as FMM and is designed to be small by reusing the data computed by KIFMM for the near-field. The far-field
calculations require no additional control parameters, and observes the same theoretical error
bound as KIFMM. We present accuracy and timing test results for the Laplace kernel in singly periodic
domains and the Stokes velocity kernel in doubly and triply periodic domains.
