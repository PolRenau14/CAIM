We consider a binary hypothesis testing problem using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The decision
is made by a fusion center and is based on received data from the sensors. We focus on a spectrum and
energy efficient transmission scheme used to reduce the spectrum usage and energy consumption
during the detection task. We propose a Spectrum and Energy Efficient Multiple Access (SEEMA) transmission
protocol that performs a censoring-type transmission based on the density of observations using
multiple access channels (MAC). Specifically, in SEEMA, only sensors with highly informative
observations transmit their data in each data collection. The sensors transmit a common shaping
waveform and the fusion center receives a superposition of the analog transmitted signals. SEEMA
has important advantages for detection tasks in WSNs. First, it is highly energy and bandwidth efficient
due to transmission savings and narrowband transmission over MAC. Second, it can be implemented
by simple dumb sensors (oblivious to observation statistics, and local data processing is not required)
which simplifies the implementation as compared to existing MAC transmission schemes for detection
in WSNs. We establish a finite sample analysis and an asymptotic analysis of the error probability
with respect to the network size and provide system design conditions to obtain the exponential
decay of the error. Specific performance analysis is developed for common non-i.i.d. observation
scenarios, including local i.i.d. observations, and Markovian correlated observations. Numerical
examples demonstrate SEEMA performance.
