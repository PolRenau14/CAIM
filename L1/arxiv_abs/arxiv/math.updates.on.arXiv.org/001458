Attaining the vision of Smart Cities requires the deployment of an enormous number of sensors for
monitoring various conditions of the environment. Backscatter-sensors have emerged to be a promising
solution due to the uninterruptible energy supply and relative simple hardwares. On the other hand,
backscatter-sensors with limited signal-processing capabilities are unable to support conventional
algorithms for multiple-access and channel-training. Thus, the key challenge in designing backscatter-sensor
networks is to enable readers to accurately detect sensing-values given simple ALOHA random access,
primitive transmission schemes, and no knowledge of channel-states. We tackle this challenge
by proposing the novel framework of backscatter sensing featuring random-encoding at sensors
and statistical-inference at readers. Specifically, assuming the on/off keying for backscatter
transmissions, the practical random-encoding scheme causes the on/off transmission of a sensor
to follow a distribution parameterized by the sensing values. Facilitated by the scheme, statistical-inference
algorithms are designed to enable a reader to infer sensing-values from randomized transmissions
by multiple sensors. The specific design procedure involves the construction of Bayesian networks,
namely deriving conditional distributions for relating unknown parameters and variables to signals
observed by the reader. Then based on the Bayesian networks and the well-known expectation-maximization
principle, inference algorithms are derived to recover sensing-values.
