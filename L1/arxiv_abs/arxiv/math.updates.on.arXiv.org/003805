Excitation of surface-plasmon resonances of closely spaced nanometallic structures is a key technique
used in nanoplasmonics to control light on subwavelength scales and generate highly confined electric-field
hotspots. In this paper we develop asymptotic approximations in the near-contact limit for the
entire set of surface-plasmon modes associated with the prototypical sphere dimer geometry. Starting
from the quasi-static plasmonic eigenvalue problem, we employ the method of matched asymptotic
expansions between a gap region, where the boundaries are approximately paraboloidal, pole regions
within the spheres and close to the gap, and a particle-scale region where the spheres appear to touch
at leading order. For those modes that are strongly localised to the gap, relating the gap and pole
regions gives a set of effective eigenvalue problems formulated over a half space representing
one of the poles. We solve these problems using integral transforms, finding asymptotic approximations,
singular in the dimensionless gap width, for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the special
case of modes that are both axisymmetric and odd about the plane bisecting the gap, where matching
with the outer region introduces a logarithmic dependence upon the dimensionless gap width, our
analysis follows [O. Schnitzer, \textit{Physical Review B}, \textbf{92} 235428 2015]. We also
analyse the so-called anomalous family of even modes, characterised by field distributions excluded
from the gap. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our asymptotic formulae and exact calculations.
