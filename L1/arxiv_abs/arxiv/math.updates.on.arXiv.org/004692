Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is an emerging technology for enhancing the computational capabilities
of mobile devices and reducing their energy consumption via offloading complex computation tasks
to the nearby servers. Multiuser MEC at servers is widely realized via parallel computing based
on virtualization. Due to finite shared I/O resources, interference between virtual machines
(VMs), called I/O interference, degrades the computation performance. In this paper, we study
the problem of joint radio-and-computation resource allocation (RCRA) in multiuser MEC systems
in the presence of I/O interference. Specifically, offloading scheduling algorithms are designed
targeting two system performance metrics: sum offloading throughput maximization and sum mobile
energy consumption minimization. Their designs are formulated as non-convex mixed-integer programming
problems, which account for latency due to offloading, result downloading and parallel computing.
A set of low-complexity algorithms are designed based on a decomposition approach and leveraging
classic techniques from combinatorial optimization. The resultant algorithms jointly schedule
offloading users, control their offloading sizes, and divide time for communication (offloading
and downloading) and computation. They are either optimal or can achieve close-to-optimality
as shown by simulation. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate considering of I/O interference
can endow on an offloading controller robustness against the performance-degradation factor.
