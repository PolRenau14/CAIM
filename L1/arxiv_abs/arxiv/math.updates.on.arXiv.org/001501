Permutation patterns-based approaches, such as permutation entropy (PerEn), have been widely
and successfully used to analyze data. However, these methods have two main shortcomings. First,
when a series is symbolized based on permutation patterns, repetition as an unavoidable phenomenon
in data is not took in to account. Second, they consider only the order of amplitude values and so,
some information regarding the amplitude values themselves may be ignored. To address these deficiencies,
we have very recently introduced dispersion patterns and subsequently, dispersion entropy (DispEn).
In this paper, we investigate the effect of different linear and non-linear mapping approaches,
used in the algorithm of DispEn, on the characterization of signals. We also inspect the sensitivity
of different parameters of DispEn to noise. Moreover, we introduce frequency-based DispEn (FDispEn)
as a measure to deal with only the frequency of time series. The results suggest that DispEn and FDispEn
with the log-sigmoid mapping approach, unlike PerEn, can detect outliers. Furthermore, the original
and frequency-based forbidden dispersion patterns are introduced to discriminate deterministic
from stochastic time series. The computation times show that DispEn and FDispEn are considerably
faster than PerEn. Finally, we find that DispEn and FDispEn outperform PerEn to distinguish various
dynamics of biomedical signals. Due to their advantages over existing entropy methods, DispEn
and FDispEn are expected to be widely used for the characterization of a wide variety of real-world
time series.
