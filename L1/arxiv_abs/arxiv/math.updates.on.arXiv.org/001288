The wiretap channel models secure communication between two users in the presence of an eavesdropper
who must be kept ignorant of transmitted messages. The performance of such a system is usually characterized
by its secrecy capacity which determines the maximum transmission rate of secure communication.
In this paper, the issue of whether or not the secrecy capacity is a continuous function of the system
parameters is examined. In particular, this is done for channel uncertainty modeled via compound
channels and arbitrarily varying channels, in which the legitimate users know only that the true
channel realization is from a pre-specified uncertainty set. In the former model, this realization
remains constant for the entire duration of transmission, while in the latter the realization varies
from channel use to channel use in an unknown and arbitrary manner. These models not only capture
the case of channel uncertainty, but are also suitable for modeling scenarios in which a malicious
adversary jams or otherwise influence the legitimate transmission. The secrecy capacity of the
compound wiretap channel is shown to be robust in the sense that it is a continuous function of the
uncertainty set. Thus, small variations in the uncertainty set lead to small variations in secrecy
capacity. On the other hand, the deterministic secrecy capacity of the \emph{arbitrarily varying
wiretap channel} is shown to be discontinuous in the uncertainty set meaning that small variations
can lead to dramatic losses in capacity.
