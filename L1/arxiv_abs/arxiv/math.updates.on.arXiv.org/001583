In physical layer security (PHY-security), the frequently observed high correlation between
the main and wiretap channels can cause a significant loss of secrecy. This paper investigates a
slow fading scenario, where a transmitter (Alice) sends a confidential message to a legitimate
receiver (Bob) while a passive eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to decode the message from its received
signal. It is assumed that Alice is equipped with multiple antennas while Bob and Eve each have a single
antenna (i.e., a MISOSE system). In a MISOSE system, high correlation results in nearly collinear
main and wiretap channel vectors, which help Eve to see and intercept confidential information.
Unfortunately, the signal processing techniques at Alice, such as beamforming and artificial
noise (AN), are helpless, especially in the extreme case of completely collinear main and wiretap
channel vectors. On this background, we first investigate the achievable secrecy outage probability
via beamforming and AN at Alice with the optimal power allocation between the information-bearing
signal and AN. Then, an ingenious model, in which a cooperative jamming relay (Relay) is introduced,
is proposed to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high correlation. Based on the proposed
model, the power allocation between the information-bearing signal at Alice and the AN at Relay
is also studied to maximize secrecy. Finally, to validate our proposed schemes, numerical simulations
are conducted, and the results show that a significant performance gain with respect to secrecy
is achieved.
