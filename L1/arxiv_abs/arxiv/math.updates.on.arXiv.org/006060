In the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework, the solution of a parametric partial differential
equation is approximated by combining the high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand for several
properly chosen configurations. Examples of the ROM application, in the naval field, can be found
in [31, 24]. Mandatory ingredient for the ROM methods is the relation between the high-fidelity
solutions and the parameters. Dealing with geometrical parameters, especially in the industrial
context, this relation may be unknown and not trivial (simulations over hand morphed geometries)
or very complex (high number of parameters or many nested morphing techniques). To overcome these
scenarios, we propose in this contribution an efficient and complete data-driven framework involving
ROM techniques for shape design and optimization, extending the pipeline presented in [7]. By applying
the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the points coordinates defining the hull geometry - assuming
the topology is inaltered by the deformation -, we are able to compute the optimal space which the
deformed geometries belong to, hence using the modal coefficients as the new parameters we can reconstruct
the parametric formulation of the domain. Finally the output of interest is approximated using
the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation technique. To conclude, we apply this
framework to a naval shape design problem where the bulbous bow is morphed to reduce the total resistance
of the ship advancing in calm water.
