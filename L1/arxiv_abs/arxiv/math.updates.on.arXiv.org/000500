Given a combinatorial decomposition for a counting problem, we resort to the simple scheme of approximating
large numbers by floating-point representations in order to obtain efficient Fully Polynomial
Time Approximation Schemes (FPTASes) for it. The number of bits employed for the exponent and the
mantissa will depend on the error parameter $0 < \varepsilon \leq 1$ and on the characteristics
of the problem. Accordingly, we propose the first FPTASes with $1 \pm \varepsilon$ relative error
for counting and generating uniformly at random a labeled DAG with a given number of vertices. This
is accomplished starting from a classical recurrence for counting DAGs, whose values we approximate
by floating-point numbers. After extending these results to other families of DAGs, we show how
the same approach works also with problems where we are given a compact representation of a combinatorial
ensemble and we are asked to count and sample elements from it. We employ here the floating-point
approximation method to transform the classic pseudo-polynomial algorithm for counting 0/1 Knapsack
solutions into a very simple FPTAS with $1 - \varepsilon$ relative error. Its complexity improves
upon the recent result (\v{S}tefankovi\v{c} et al., SIAM J. Comput., 2012), and, when $\varepsilon^{-1}
= \Omega(n)$, also upon the best-known randomized algorithm (Dyer, STOC, 2003). To show the versatility
of this technique, we also apply it to a recent generalization of the problem of counting 0/1 Knapsack
solutions in an arc-weighted DAG, obtaining a faster and simpler FPTAS than the existing one.
