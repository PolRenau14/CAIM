This work aims at combining adaptive protocol design, utility maximization and stochastic geometry.
We focus on a spatial adaptation of Aloha within the framework of ad hoc networks. We consider quasi-static
networks in which mobiles learn the local topology and incorporate this information to adapt their
medium access probability (MAP) selection to their local environment. We consider the cases where
nodes cooperate in a distributed way to maximize the global throughput or to achieve either proportional
fair or max-min fair medium access. In the proportional fair case, we show that nodes can compute
their optimal MAPs as solutions to certain fixed point equations. In the maximum throughput case,
the optimal MAPs are obtained through a Gibbs Sampling based algorithm. In the max min case, these
are obtained as the solution of a convex optimization problem. The main performance analysis result
of the paper is that this type of distributed adaptation can be analyzed using stochastic geometry
in the proportional fair case. In this case, we show that, when the nodes form a homogeneous Poisson
point process in the Euclidean plane, the distribution of the optimal MAP can be obtained from that
of a certain shot noise process w.r.t. the node Poisson point process and that the mean utility can
also be derived from this distribution. We discuss the difficulties to be faced for analyzing the
performance of the other cases (maximum throughput and max-min fairness). Numerical results illustrate
our findings and quantify the gains brought by spatial adaptation in such networks.
