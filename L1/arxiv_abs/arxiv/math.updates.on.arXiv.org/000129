Nonseparable panel models are important in a variety of economic settings, including discrete
choice. This paper gives identification and estimation results for nonseparable models under
time homogeneity conditions that are like "time is randomly assigned" or "time is an instrument."
Partial identification results for average and quantile effects are given for discrete regressors,
under static or dynamic conditions, in fully nonparametric and in semiparametric models, with
time effects. It is shown that the usual, linear, fixed-effects estimator is not a consistent estimator
of the identified average effect, and a consistent estimator is given. A simple estimator of identified
quantile treatment effects is given, providing a solution to the important problem of estimating
quantile treatment effects from panel data. Bounds for overall effects in static and dynamic models
are given. The dynamic bounds provide a partial identification solution to the important problem
of estimating the effect of state dependence in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The impact
of $T$, the number of time periods, is shown by deriving shrinkage rates for the identified set as
$T$ grows. We also consider semiparametric, discrete-choice models and find that semiparametric
panel bounds can be much tighter than nonparametric bounds. Computationally-convenient methods
for semiparametric models are presented. We propose a novel inference method that applies in panel
data and other settings and show that it produces uniformly valid confidence regions in large samples.
We give empirical illustrations.
