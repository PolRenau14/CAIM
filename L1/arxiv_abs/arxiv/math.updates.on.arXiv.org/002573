Regular spatially-Coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) ensembles have gained significant interest since they
were shown to universally achieve the capacity of binary memoryless channels under low-complexity
belief-propagation decoding. In this work, we focus primarily on the performance of these ensembles
over binary channels affected by bursts of erasures. We first develop an analysis of the finite length
performance for a single burst per codeword and no errors otherwise. We first assume that the burst
erases a complete spatial position, modeling for instance node failures in distributed storage.
We provide new tight lower bounds for the block erasure probability ($P_{\mathrm{B}}$) at finite
block length and bounds on the coupling parameter for being asymptotically able to recover the burst.
We further show that expurgating the ensemble can improve the block erasure probability by several
orders of magnitude. Later we extend our methodology to more general channel models. In a first extension,
we consider bursts that can start at a random position in the codeword and span across multiple spatial
positions. Besides the finite length analysis, we determine by means of density evolution the maximnum
correctable burst length. In a second extension, we consider the case where in addition to a single
burst, random bit erasures may occur. Finally, we consider a block erasure channel model which erases
each spatial position independently with some probability $p$, potentially introducing multiple
bursts simultaneously. All results are verified using Monte-Carlo simulations.
