Data centres that use consumer-grade disks drives and distributed peer-to-peer systems are unreliable
environments to archive data without enough redundancy. Most redundancy schemes are not completely
effective for providing high availability, durability and integrity in the long-term. We propose
alpha entanglement codes, a mechanism that creates a virtual layer of highly interconnected storage
devices to propagate redundant information across a large scale storage system. Our motivation
is to design flexible and practical erasure codes with high fault-tolerance to improve data durability
and availability even in catastrophic scenarios. By flexible and practical, we mean code settings
that can be adapted to future requirements and practical implementations with reasonable trade-offs
between security, resource usage and performance. The codes have three parameters. Alpha increases
storage overhead linearly but increases the possible paths to recover data exponentially. Two
other parameters increase fault-tolerance even further without the need of additional storage.
As a result, an entangled storage system can provide high availability, durability and offer additional
integrity: it is more difficult to modify data undetectably. We evaluate how several redundancy
schemes perform in unreliable environments and show that alpha entanglement codes are flexible
and practical codes. Remarkably, they excel at code locality, hence, they reduce repair costs and
become less dependent on storage locations with poor availability. Our solution outperforms Reed-Solomon
codes in many disaster recovery scenarios.
