We study the strategic decision-making problem of assigning time windows to customers in the context
of vehicle routing applications that are affected by operational uncertainty. This problem, known
as the Time Window Assignment Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization
problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions, vehicle routes adhering
to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage decisions, and the objective is to minimize
the expected routing costs. We prove that a sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic
model can be reduced to a variant of the Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem, and we leverage this
result to develop a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve it. From a modeling viewpoint,
our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete sets of feasible time window assignments
as well as general scenario-based models of uncertainty for several routing-specific parameters,
including customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint, our
approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle routing solver as a black
box, and can be readily modified as a heuristic for large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive
computational study to demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution
methods, as well as to quantify the trade-off between computational tractability and expected
cost savings when considering a larger number of future scenarios during strategic time window
assignment.
