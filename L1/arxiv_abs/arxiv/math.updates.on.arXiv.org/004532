This paper considers a downlink single-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network with
uniformly deployed users, while a mixed multicast and unicast traffic scenario is taken into account.
By guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of the multicast traffic, the multicast outage and
secrecy unicast throughput performance is evaluated. In particular, two types of partial channel
state information (CSI), namely the imperfect CSI and CSI based on second order statistics (SOS),
are investigated in the analytical framework. For both two cases, the closed-form approximations
for the multicast outage probability and secrecy unicast throughput are derived except that the
approximation for the secrecy unicast throughput in SOS-based CSI only concerns two users. As to
the multicast outage probability, the simulation results demonstrate that the NOMA scheme considered
in both two cases achieves superior performance compared to the traditional orthogonal multiple
access (OMA) scheme, while for the secrecy unicast throughput, the NOMA scheme shows great advantages
over the OMA scheme in good condition (high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)), but is inferior to the
OMA scheme in poor condition (low SNR). Moreover, both two cases achieve similar performance except
that the NOMA scheme with imperfect CSI obtains larger secrecy unicast throughput than that based
on SOS under high SNR condition. Finally, the provided numerical results also confirm that the derived
approximations of both two cases for the multicast outage probability and secrecy unicast throughput
match well with the Monte Carlo simulations.
