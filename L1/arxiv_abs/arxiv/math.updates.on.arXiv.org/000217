The paper describes development (improvement/extension) approaches for composite (modular)
systems (as combinatorial reengineering). The following system improvement/extension actions
are considered: (a) improvement of systems component(s) (e.g., improvement of a system component,
replacement of a system component); (b) improvement of system component interconnection (compatibility);
(c) joint improvement improvement of system components(s) and their interconnection; (d) improvement
of system structure (replacement of system part(s), addition of a system part, deletion of a system
part, modification of system structure). The study of system improvement approaches involve some
crucial issues: (i) scales for evaluation of system components and component compatibility (quantitative
scale, ordinal scale, poset-like scale, scale based on interval multiset estimate), (ii) evaluation
of integrated system quality, (iii) integration methods to obtain the integrated system quality.
The system improvement/extension strategies can be examined as seleciton/combination of the
improvement action(s) above and as modification of system structure. The strategies are based
on combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., multicriteria selection, knapsack problem, multiple
choice problem, combinatorial synthesis based on morphological clique problem, assignment/reassignment
problem, graph recoloring problem, spanning problems, hotlink assignment). Here, heuristics
are used. Various system improvement/extension strategies are presented including illustrative
numerical examples.
