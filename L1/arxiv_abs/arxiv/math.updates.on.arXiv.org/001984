We study the transmission over a network in which users send information to a remote destination
through relay nodes that are connected to the destination via finite-capacity error-free links,
i.e., a cloud radio access network. The relays are constrained to operate without knowledge of the
users' codebooks, i.e., they perform oblivious processing. The destination, or central processor,
however, is informed about the users' codebooks. We establish a single-letter characterization
of the capacity region of this model for a class of discrete memoryless channels in which the outputs
at the relay nodes are independent given the users' inputs. We show that both relaying \`a-la Cover-El
Gamal, i.e., compress-and-forward with joint decompression and decoding, and "noisy network
coding", are optimal. The proof of the converse part establishes, and utilizes, connections with
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) source coding problem under logarithmic loss distortion measure.
Extensions to general discrete memoryless channels are also investigated. In this case, we establish
inner and outer bounds on the capacity region. For memoryless Gaussian channels within the studied
class of channels, we characterize the capacity region when the users are constrained to time-share
among Gaussian codebooks. We also discuss the suboptimality of separate decompression-decoding
and the role of time-sharing. Furthermore, we study the related distributed information bottleneck
problem and characterize optimal tradeoffs between rates (i.e., complexity) and information
(i.e., accuracy) in the vector Gaussian case.
