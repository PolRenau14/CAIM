Content distribution is an application in intelligent transportation system to assist vehicles
in acquiring information such as digital maps and entertainment materials. In this paper, we consider
content distribution from a single roadside infrastructure unit to a group of vehicles passing
by it. To combat the short connection time and the lossy channel quality, the downloaded contents
need to be further shared among vehicles after the initial broadcasting phase. To this end, we propose
a joint infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scheme
based on batched sparse (BATS) coding to minimize the traffic overhead and reduce the total transmission
delay. In the I2V phase, the roadside unit (RSU) encodes the original large-size file into a number
of batches in a rateless manner, each containing a fixed number of coded packets, and sequentially
broadcasts them during the I2V connection time. In the V2V phase, vehicles perform the network coded
cooperative sharing by re-encoding the received packets. We propose a utility-based distributed
algorithm to efficiently schedule the V2V cooperative transmissions, hence reducing the transmission
delay. A closed-form expression for the expected rank distribution of the proposed content distribution
scheme is derived, which is used to design the optimal BATS code. The performance of the proposed
content distribution scheme is evaluated by extensive simulations that consider multi-lane road
and realistic vehicular traffic settings, and shown to significantly outperform the existing
content distribution protocols.
