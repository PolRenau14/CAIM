The Lorentz equations describe the motion of electrically charged particles in electric and magnetic
fields and are used widely in plasma physics. The most popular numerical algorithm for solving them
is the Boris method, a variant of the St\"ormer-Verlet algorithm. Boris' method is phase space volume
conserving and simulated particles typically remain near the correct trajectory. However, it
is only second order accurate. Therefore, in scenarios where it is not enough to know that a particle
stays on the right trajectory but one needs to know where on the trajectory the particle is at a given
time, Boris method requires very small time steps to deliver accurate phase information, making
it computationally expensive. We derive an improved version of the high-order Boris spectral deferred
correction algorithm (Boris-SDC) by adopting a convergence acceleration strategy for second
order problems based on the Generalised Minimum Residual (GMRES) method. Our new algorithm is easy
to implement as it still relies on the standard Boris method. Like Boris-SDC it can deliver arbitrary
order of accuracy through simple changes of runtime parameter but possesses better long-term energy
stability. We demonstrate for two examples, a magnetic mirror trap and the Solev'ev equilibrium,
that the new method can deliver better accuracy at lower computational cost compared to the standard
Boris method. While our examples are motivated by tracking ions in the magnetic field of a nuclear
fusion reactor, the introduced algorithm can potentially deliver similar improvements in efficiency
for other applications.
