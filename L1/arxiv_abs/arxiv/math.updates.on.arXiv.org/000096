We consider a multivariate version of the so-called Lancaster problem of characterizing canonical
correlation coefficients of symmetric bivariate distributions with identical marginals and
orthogonal polynomial expansions. The marginal distributions examined in this paper are the Dirichlet
and the Dirichlet multinomial distribution, respectively, on the continuous and the N-discrete
d-dimensional simplex. Their infinite-dimensional limit distributions, respectively, the
Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and Ewens's sampling formula, are considered as well. We study,
in particular, the possibility of mapping canonical correlations on the d-dimensional continuous
simplex (i) to canonical correlation sequences on the d+1-dimensional simplex and/or (ii) to canonical
correlations on the discrete simplex, and vice versa. Driven by this motivation, the first half
of the paper is devoted to providing a full characterization and probabilistic interpretation
of n-orthogonal polynomial kernels (i.e., sums of products of orthogonal polynomials of the same
degree n) with respect to the mentioned marginal distributions. We establish several identities
and some integral representations which are multivariate extensions of important results known
for the case d=2 since the 1970s. These results, along with a common interpretation of the mentioned
kernels in terms of dependent Polya urns, are shown to be key features leading to several non-trivial
solutions to Lancaster's problem, many of which can be extended naturally to the limit as $d\rightarrow\infty$.
