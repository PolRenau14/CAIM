Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems are expected to be the core
technology in fifth-generation wireless systems because they significantly improve spectral
efficiency. However, the requirement for a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains results
in high hardware costs and power consumption, which obstruct the commercial deployment of massive
MIMO systems. A potential solution is to use low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DAC)/analog-to-digital
converters for each antenna and RF chain. However, using low-resolution DACs at the transmit side
directly limits the degree of freedom of output signals and thus poses a challenge to the precoding
design. In this study, we develop efficient and universal algorithms for a downlink massive MU-MIMO
system with finite-alphabet precodings. Our algorithms are developed based on the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. The original ADMM does not converge in a nonlinear
discrete optimization problem. The primary cause of this problem is that the alternating (update)
directions in ADMM on one side are biased, and those on the other side are unbiased. {By making the
two updates consistent in an unbiased manner, we develop two algorithms called iterative discrete
estimation (IDE) and IDE2: IDE demonstrates excellent performance and IDE2 possesses a significantly
low computational complexity.} Compared with state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed precoding
algorithms present significant advantages in performance and computational complexity.
