Recent works have shown that random triangulations decorated by critical ($p=1/2$) Bernoulli
site percolation converge in the scaling limit to a $\sqrt{8/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG)
surface (equivalently, a Brownian surface) decorated by SLE$_6$ in two different ways: 1. The triangulation,
viewed as a curve-decorated metric measure space equipped with its graph distance, the counting
measure on vertices, and a single percolation interface converges with respect to a version of the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology. 2. There is a bijective encoding of the site-percolated triangulation
by means of a two-dimensional random walk, and this walk converges to the correlated two-dimensional
Brownian motion which encodes SLE$_6$-decorated $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG via the mating-of-trees theorem
of Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield (2014); this is sometimes called $\textit{peanosphere convergence}$.
We prove that one in fact has $\textit{joint}$ convergence in both of these two senses simultaneously.
We also improve the metric convergence result by showing that the map decorated by the full collection
of percolation interfaces (rather than just a single interface) converges to $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG
decorated by CLE$_6$ in the metric space sense. This is the first work to prove simultaneous convergence
of any random planar map model in the metric and peanosphere senses. Moreover, this work is an important
step in an ongoing program to prove that random triangulations embedded into $\mathbb C$ via the
so-called $\textit{Cardy embedding}$ converge to $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG.
