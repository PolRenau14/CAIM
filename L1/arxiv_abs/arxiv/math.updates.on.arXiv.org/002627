Wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs), where multiple energy-limited devices first
harvest energy in the downlink and then transmit information in the uplink, have been envisioned
as a promising solution for the future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the fifth-generation
(5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple users in the same spectrum. As such,
NOMA has been recently considered for the uplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number
of devices. However, simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy consumption
as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical for energy constrained IoT devices.
As a result, compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access
(TDMA), whether the SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with NOMA
in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we first derive the optimal time
allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based WPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN),
respectively. Subsequently, we analyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved
by these two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes more energy, but also
is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and
unveil the fundamental performance bottleneck, i.e., "worst user bottleneck problem", in multiuser
NOMA systems.
