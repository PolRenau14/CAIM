This article describes a data center hosting a web portal for accessing and sharing the output of
large, cosmological, hydro-dynamical simulations with a broad scientific community. It also
allows users to receive related scientific data products by directly processing the raw simulation
data on a remote computing cluster. The data center has a multi-layer structure: a web portal, a job
control layer, a computing cluster and a HPC storage system. The outer layer enables users to choose
an object from the simulations. Objects can be selected by visually inspecting 2D maps of the simulation
data, by performing highly compounded and elaborated queries or graphically by plotting arbitrary
combinations of properties. The user can run analysis tools on a chosen object. These services allow
users to run analysis tools on the raw simulation data. The job control layer is responsible for handling
and performing the analysis jobs, which are executed on a computing cluster. The innermost layer
is formed by a HPC storage system which hosts the large, raw simulation data. The following services
are available for the users: (I) {\sc ClusterInspect} visualizes properties of member galaxies
of a selected galaxy cluster; (II) {\sc SimCut} returns the raw data of a sub-volume around a selected
object from a simulation, containing all the original, hydro-dynamical quantities; (III) {\sc
Smac} creates idealised 2D maps of various, physical quantities and observables of a selected object;
(IV) {\sc Phox} generates virtual X-ray observations with specifications of various current and
upcoming instruments.
