The merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs can lead either to a spectacular transient, stable
nuclear burning or a massive, rapidly rotating white dwarf. Simulations of mergers have shown that
the outcome strongly depends on whether the white dwarfs are similar or dissimilar in mass. In the
similar-mass case, both white dwarfs merge fully and the remnant is hot throughout, while in the
dissimilar case, the more massive, denser white dwarf remains cold and essentially intact, with
the disrupted lower mass one wrapped around it in a hot envelope and disk. In order to determine what
constitutes "similar in mass" and more generally how the properties of the merger remnant depend
on the input masses, we simulated unsynchronized carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers for a large
range of masses using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. We find that the structure of the merger
remnant varies smoothly as a function of the ratio of the central densities of the two white dwarfs.
A density ratio of 0.6 approximately separates similar and dissimilar mass mergers. Confirming
previous work, we find that the temperatures of most merger remnants are not high enough to immediately
ignite carbon fusion. During subsequent viscous evolution, however, the interior will likely
be compressed and heated as the disk accretes and the remnant spins down. We find from simple estimates
that this evolution can lead to ignition for many remnants. For similar-mass mergers, this would
likely occur under sufficiently degenerate conditions that a thermonuclear runaway would ensue.
