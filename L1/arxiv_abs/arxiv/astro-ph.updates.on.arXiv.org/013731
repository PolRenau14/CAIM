We examine the different element abundances exhibited by the closed loop solar corona and the slow
speed solar wind. Both are subject to the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect, the enhancement
in coronal abundance of elements with FIP below 10 eV (e.g. Mg, Si, Fe) with respect to high FIP elements
(e.g. O, Ne, Ar), but with subtle differences. Intermediate elements, S, P, and C, with FIP just above
10 eV, behave as high FIP elements in closed loops, but are fractionated more like low FIP elements
in the solar wind. On the basis of FIP fractionation by the ponderomotive force in the chromosphere,
we discuss fractionation scenarios where this difference might originate. Fractionation low
in the chromosphere where hydrogen is neutral enhances the S, P and C abundances. This arises with
nonresonant waves, which are ubiquitous in open field regions, and is also stronger with torsional
Alfven waves, as opposed to shear (i.e. planar) waves. We discuss the bearing these findings have
on models of interchange reconnection as the source of the slow speed solar wind. The outflowing
solar wind must ultimately be a mixture of the plasma in the originally open and closed fields, and
the proportions and degree of mixing should depend on details of the reconnection process. We also
describe novel diagnostics in ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy now available
with these new insights, with the prospect of investigating slow speed solar wind origins and the
contribution of interchange reconnection by remote sensing.
