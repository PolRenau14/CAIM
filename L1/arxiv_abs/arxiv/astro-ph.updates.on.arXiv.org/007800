We present a simulation code which can solve broad ranges of partial differential equations in a
full sphere. The code expands tensorial variables in a spectral series of spin-weighted spherical
harmonics in the angular directions and a scaled Jacobi polynomial basis in the radial direction,
as described in Part-I. Nonlinear terms are calculated by transforming from the coefficients in
the spectral series to the value of each quantity on the physical grid, where it is easy to calculate
products and perform other local operations. The expansion makes it straightforward to solve equations
in tensor form (i.e., without decomposition into scalars). We propose and study several unit tests
which demonstrate the code can accurately solve linear problems, implement boundary conditions,
and transform between spectral and physical space. We then run a series of benchmark problems proposed
in Marti et al (2014), implementing the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic equations. We are
able to calculate more accurate solutions than reported in Marti et al 2014 by running at higher spatial
resolution and using a higher-order timestepping scheme. We find the rotating convection and convective
dynamo benchmark problems depend sensitively on details of timestepping and data analysis. We
also demonstrate that in low resolution simulations of the dynamo problem, small changes in a numerical
scheme can lead to large changes in the solution. To aid future comparison to these benchmarks, we
include the source code used to generate the data, as well as the data and analysis scripts used to
generate the figures.
