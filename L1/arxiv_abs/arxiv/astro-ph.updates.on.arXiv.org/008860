Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, driven by radiation pressure on dust, is an important mechanism
for efficiently coupling the accreting black hole to the surrounding environment. Recent observations
confirm that X-ray selected AGN samples respect the effective Eddington limit for dusty gas in the
plane defined by the observed column density versus the Eddington ratio, the so-called $N_{\rm
H} - \lambda$ plane. A `forbidden' region occurs in this plane, where obscuring clouds cannot be
long-lived, due to the action of radiation pressure on dust. Here we compute the effective Eddington
limit by explicitly taking into account the trapping of reprocessed radiation (which has been neglected
in previous works), and investigate its impact on the $N_{\rm H} - \lambda$ plane. We show that the
inclusion of radiation trapping leads to an enhanced forbidden region, such that even Compton-thick
material can potentially be disrupted by sub-Eddington luminosities. We compare our model results
to the most complete sample of local AGNs with measured X-ray properties, and find good agreement.
Considering the anisotropic emission from the accretion disc, we also expect the development of
dusty outflows along the polar axis, which may naturally account for the polar dust emission recently
detected in several AGNs from mid-infrared observations. Radiative feedback thus appears to be
the key mechanism regulating the obscuration properties of AGNs, and we discuss its physical implications
in the context of co-evolution scenarios.
