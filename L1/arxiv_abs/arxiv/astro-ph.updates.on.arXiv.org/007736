We simulate a self-gravitating, turbulent cloud of 1000 Msol with photoionization and radiation
pressure feedback from a 34 Msol star. We use a detailed Monte Carlo radiative transfer scheme alongside
the hydrodynamics to compute photoionization and thermal equilibrium with dust grains and multiple
atomic species. Using these gas temperatures, dust temperatures, and ionization fractions, we
produce self-consistent synthetic observations of line and continuum emission. We find that all
material is dispersed from the (15.5 pc)$^3$ grid within 1.6 Myr or 0.74 free-fall times. Mass exits
with a peak flux of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ Msol/yr, showing efficient gas dispersal. The model without
radiation pressure has a slight delay in the breakthrough of ionization, but overall its effects
are negligible. 85 per cent of the volume, and 40 per cent of the mass, become ionized -- dense filaments
resist ionization and are swept up into spherical cores with pillars that point radially away from
the ionizing star. We use free-free emission at 20 cm to estimate the production rate of ionizing
photons. This is almost always underestimated: by a factor of a few at early stages, then by orders
of magnitude as mass leaves the volume. We also test the ratio of dust continuum surface brightnesses
at 450 and 850 micron to probe dust temperatures. This underestimates the actual temperature by
more than a factor of 2 in areas of low column density or high line-of-sight temperature dispersion;
the HII region cavity is particularly prone to this discrepancy. However, the probe is accurate
in dense locations such as filaments.
