Uncertainty quantification is a critical missing component in radio interferometric imaging
that will only become increasingly important as the big-data era of radio interferometry emerges.
Since radio interferometric imaging requires solving a high-dimensional, ill-posed inverse
problem, uncertainty quantification is difficult but also critical to the accurate scientific
interpretation of radio observations. Statistical sampling approaches to perform Bayesian inference,
like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, can in principle recover the full posterior distribution
of the image, from which uncertainties can then be quantified. However, traditional high-dimensional
sampling methods are generally limited to smooth (e.g. Gaussian) priors and cannot be used with
sparsity-promoting priors. Sparse priors, motivated by the theory of compressive sensing, have
been shown to be highly effective for radio interferometric imaging. In this article proximal MCMC
methods are developed for radio interferometric imaging, leveraging proximal calculus to support
non-differential priors, such as sparse priors, in a Bayesian framework. Furthermore, three strategies
to quantify uncertainties using the recovered posterior distribution are developed: (i) local
(pixel-wise) credible intervals to provide error bars for each individual pixel; (ii) highest
posterior density credible regions; and (iii) hypothesis testing of image structure. These forms
of uncertainty quantification provide rich information for analysing radio interferometric
observations in a statistically robust manner.
