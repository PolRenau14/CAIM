Winds arising from galaxies, star clusters, and active galactic nuclei are crucial players in star
and galaxy formation, but it has proven remarkably difficult to use observations of them to determine
physical properties of interest, particularly mass fluxes. Much of the difficulty stems from a
lack of a theory that links a physically-realistic model for winds' density, velocity, and covering
factors to calculations of light emission and absorption. In this paper we provide such a model.
We consider a wind launched from a turbulent region with a range of column densities, derive the differential
acceleration of gas as a function of column density, and use this result to compute winds' absorption
profiles, emission profiles, and emission intensity maps in both optically thin and optically
thick species. The model is sufficiently simple that all required computations can be done analytically
up to straightforward numerical integrals, rendering it suitable for the problem of deriving physical
parameters by fitting models to observed data. We show that our model produces realistic absorption
and emission profiles for some example cases, and argue that the most promising methods of deducing
mass fluxes are based on combinations of absorption lines of different optical depths, or on combining
absorption with measurements of molecular line emission. In the second paper in this series, we
expand on these ideas by introducing a set of observational diagnostics that are significantly
more robust that those commonly in use, and that can be used to obtain improved estimates of wind properties.
