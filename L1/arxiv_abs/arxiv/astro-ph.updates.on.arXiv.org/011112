We study how jets driven by active galactic nuclei influence the cooling flow in Perseus-like galaxy
cluster cores with idealised, non-relativistic, hydrodynamical simulations performed with
the Eulerian code ATHENA using high-resolution Godunov methods with low numerical diffusion.
We use novel analysis methods to measure the cooling rate, the heating rate associated to multiple
mechanisms, and the power associated with adiabatic compression/expansion. A significant reduction
of the cooling rate and cooling flow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets.
However, at larger scales and away from the jet axis, the system relaxes to a cooling flow configuration.
Jet feedback is anisotropic and is mostly distributed along the jet axis, where the cooling rate
is reduced and a significant fraction of the jet power is converted into kinetic power of heated outflowing
gas. Away from the jet axis weak shock heating represents the dominant heating source. Turbulent
heating is significant only near the cluster centre, but it becomes inefficient at 50 kpc scales
where it only represents a few percent of the total heating rate. Several details of the simulations
depend on the choice made for the hydro solver, a consequence of the difficulty of achieving proper
numerical convergence for this problem: current physics implementations and resolutions do not
properly capture multi-phase gas that develops as a consequence of thermal instability. These
processes happen at the grid scale and leave numerical solutions sensitive to the properties of
the chosen hydro solver.
