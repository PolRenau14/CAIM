The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to
Mars (~ 1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and
simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts cause the
so-called Forbush decrease, which can be de- tected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured
on-ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in-situ measurements at Earth, from
both STEREO A and B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument
onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected
during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same
side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate
the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush
decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds
before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction
with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed
evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events.
Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models,
namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.
