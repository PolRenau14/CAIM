The obscuring circumnuclear torus of dusty molecular gas is one of the major components of active
galactic nuclei (AGN). The torus can be studied by analyzing the time response of its infrared (IR)
dust emission to variations in the AGN continuum luminosity, a technique known as reverberation
mapping. The IR response is the convolution of the AGN ultraviolet/optical light curve with a transfer
function that contains information about the size, geometry, and structure of the torus. Here,
we describe a new computer model that simulates the reverberation response of a clumpy torus. Given
an input optical light curve, the code computes the emission of a 3D ensemble of dust clouds as a function
of time at selected IR wavelengths, taking into account light travel delays. We present simulated
dust emission responses at 3.6, 4.5, and 30 $\mu$m that explore the effects of various geometrical
and structural properties, dust cloud orientation, and anisotropy of the illuminating radiation
field. We also briefly explore the effects of cloud shadowing (clouds are shielded from the AGN continuum
source). Example synthetic light curves have also been generated, using the observed optical light
curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 6418 as the input. The torus response is strongly wavelength-dependent,
due to the gradient in cloud surface temperature within the torus, and because the cloud emission
is strongly anisotropic at shorter wavelengths. Anisotropic illumination of the torus also significantly
modifies the torus response, reducing the lag between the IR and optical variations.
