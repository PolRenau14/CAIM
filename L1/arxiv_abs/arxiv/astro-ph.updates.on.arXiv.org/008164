The precise determination of the instrumental response function versus wavelength is a central
ingredient in contemporary photometric calibration strategies. This typically entails propagating
narrowband illumination through the system pupil, and comparing the detected photon rate across
the focal plane to the amount of incident light as measured by a calibrated photodiode. However,
stray light effects and reflections/ghosting (especially on the edges of filter passbands) in
the optical train constitute a major source of systematic uncertainty when using a flat-field screen
as the illumination source. A collimated beam projector that projects a mask onto the focal plane
of the instrument can distinguish focusing light paths from stray and scattered light, allowing
for a precise determination of instrumental throughput. This paper describes the conceptual design
of such a system, outlines its merits, and presents results from a prototype system used with the
Dark Energy Camera wide field imager on the 4-meter Blanco telescope. A calibration scheme that
blends results from flat-field images with collimated beam projector data to obtain the equivalent
of an illumination correction at high spectral and angular resolution is also presented. In addition
to providing a precise system throughput calibration, by monitoring the evolution of the intensity
and behaviour of the ghosts in the optical system, the collimated beam projector can be used to track
the evolution of the filter transmission properties and various anti-reflective coatings in the
optical system.
