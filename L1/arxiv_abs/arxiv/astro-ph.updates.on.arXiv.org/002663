We present a series of radiative MHD simulations addressing the origin and distribution of mixed
polarity magnetic field in the solar photosphere. To this end we consider numerical simulations
that cover the uppermost 2-6 Mm of the solar convection zone and we explore scales ranging from 2 km
to 25 Mm. We study how the strength and distribution of magnetic field in the photosphere and subsurface
layers depend on resolution, domain size and boundary conditions. We find that 50% of the magnetic
energy at the \tau=1 level comes from field with the less than 500 G strength and that 50% of the energy
resides on scales smaller than about 100 km. While probability distribution functions are essentially
independent of resolution, properly describing the spectral energy distribution requires grid
spacings of 8 km or smaller. The formation of flux concentrations in the photosphere exceeding 1
kG requires a mean vertical field strength greater than 30-40 G at \tau=1. The filling factor of kG
flux concentrations increases with overall domain size as magnetic field becomes organized by
larger, longer lived flow structures. A solution with a mean vertical field strength of around 85
G at \tau=1 requires a subsurface RMS field strength increasing with depth at the same rate as the
equipartition field strength. We consider this an upper limit for the quiet Sun field strength,
which implies that most of the convection zone is magnetized close to equipartition. We discuss
these findings in view of recent high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of quiet Sun
magnetism.
