We present the calibration and reduction of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 1.3mm radio wavelength
observations of the supermassive black hole candidate at the center of the radio galaxy M87 and the
quasar 3C 279, taken during the 2017 April 5-11 observing campaign. These global very long baseline
interferometric observations include for the first time the highly sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA); reaching an angular resolution of 25 micro-as, with characteristic sensitivity
limits of ~1 mJy on baselines to ALMA and ~10 mJy on other baselines. The observations present challenges
for existing data processing tools, arising from the rapid atmospheric phase fluctuations, wide
recording bandwidth, and highly heterogeneous array. In response, we developed three independent
pipelines for phase calibration and fringe detection, each tailored to the specific needs of the
EHT. The final data products include calibrated total intensity amplitude and phase information.
They are validated through a series of quality assurance tests that show consistency across pipelines
and set limits on baseline systematic errors of 2% in amplitude and 1 degree in phase. The M87 data
reveal the presence of two nulls in correlated flux density at ~3.4 and ~8.3 giga-lambda and temporal
evolution in closure quantities, indicating intrinsic variability of compact structure on a timescale
of days, or several light-crossing times for a few billion solar-mass black hole. These measurements
provide the first opportunity to image horizon-scale structure in M87.
