Data acquired from multi-channel sensors is a highly valuable asset to interpret the environment
for a variety of remote sensing applications. However, low spatial resolution is a critical limitation
for previous sensors and the constituent materials of a scene can be mixed in different fractions
due to their spatial interactions. Spectral unmixing is a technique that allows us to obtain the
material spectral signatures and their fractions from hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose
a novel hyperspectral unmixing scheme, so called \textit{EndNet}, that is based on a two-staged
autoencoder network. This well-known structure is completely enhanced and restructured by introducing
additional layers and a projection metric (i.e., spectral angle distance (SAD) instead of inner
product) to achieve an optimum solution. Moreover, we present a novel loss function that is composed
of a Kullback-Leibler divergence term with SAD similarity and additional penalty terms to improve
the sparsity of the estimates. These modifications enable us to set the common properties of endmembers
such as non-linearity and sparsity for autoencoder networks. Lastly, due to the stochastic-gradient
based approach, the method is scalable for large-scale data and it can be accelerated on Graphical
Processing Units (GPUs). To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct extensive
experiments on several well-known datasets. The results confirm that the proposed method considerably
improves the performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques in literature.
