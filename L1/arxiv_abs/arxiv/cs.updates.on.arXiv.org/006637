This chapter focuses on the analysis of current publication trends in gold Open Access (OA). The
purpose of the chapter is to develop a full understanding on country patterns, OA journals characteristics
and citation differences between gold OA and non-gold OA publications. For this, we will first review
current literature regarding Open Access and its relation with its so-called citation advantage.
Starting with a chronological perspective we will describe its development, how different countries
are promoting OA publishing, and its effects on the journal publishing industry. We will deepen
the analysis by investigating the research output produced by different units of analysis. First,
we will focus on the production of countries with a special emphasis on citation and disciplinary
differences. A point of interest will be identification of national idiosyncrasies and the relation
between OA publication and research of local interest. This will lead to our second unit of analysis,
OA journals indexed in Web of Science. Here we will deepen on journals characteristics and publisher
types to clearly identify factors which may affect citation differences between OA and traditional
journals which may not necessarily be derived from the OA factor. Gold OA publishing is being encouraged
in many countries as opposed to Green OA. This chapter aims at fully understanding how it affects
researchers' publication patterns and whether it ensures an alleged citation advantage as opposed
to non-gold OA publications.
