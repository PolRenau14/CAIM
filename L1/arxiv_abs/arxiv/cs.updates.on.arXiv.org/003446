We consider the classical setting of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single message (file)
out of $M$ messages from $N$ distributed databases under the new constraint of \emph{asymmetric
traffic} from databases. In this problem, the \emph{ratios between the traffic} from the databases
are constrained, i.e., the ratio of the length of the answer string that the user (retriever) receives
from the $n$th database to the total length of all answer strings from all databases is constrained
to be $\tau_n$. This may happen if the user's access to the databases is restricted due database availability,
channel quality to the databases, and other factors. For this problem, for fixed $M$, $N$, we develop
a general upper bound $\bar{C}(\boldsymbol{\tau})$, which generalizes the converse proof of
Sun-Jafar, where database symmetry was inherently used. Our converse bound is a piece-wise affine
function in the traffic ratio vector $\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_N)$. For the lower
bound, we explicitly show the achievability of $\binom{M+N-1}{M}$ corner points. For the remaining
traffic ratio vectors, we perform time-sharing between these corner points. The recursive structure
of our achievability scheme is captured via a system of difference equations. The upper and lower
bounds exactly match for $M=2$ and $M=3$ for any $N$ and any $\boldsymbol{\tau}$. The results show
strict loss of PIR capacity due to the asymmetric traffic constraints compared with the symmetric
case of Sun-Jafar which implicitly uses $\tau_n=\frac{1}{N}$ for all $n$.
