Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used dimension reduction techniques.
Robust PCA (RPCA) refers to the problem of PCA when the data may be corrupted by outliers. Recent work
by Cand{\`e}s, Wright, Li, and Ma defined RPCA as a problem of decomposing a given data matrix into
the sum of a low-rank matrix (true data) and a sparse matrix (outliers). The column space of the low-rank
matrix then gives the PCA solution. This simple definition has lead to a large amount of interesting
new work on provably correct, fast, and practical solutions to RPCA. More recently, the dynamic
(time-varying) version of the RPCA problem has been studied and a series of provably correct, fast,
and memory efficient tracking solutions have been proposed. Dynamic RPCA (or robust subspace tracking)
is the problem of tracking data lying in a (slowly) changing subspace while being robust to sparse
outliers. This article provides an exhaustive review of the last decade of literature on RPCA and
its dynamic counterpart (robust subspace tracking), along with describing their theoretical
guarantees, discussing the pros and cons of various approaches, and providing empirical comparisons
of performance and speed. A brief overview of the (low-rank) matrix completion literature is also
provided (the focus is on works not discussed in other recent reviews). This refers to the problem
of completing a low-rank matrix when only a subset of its entries are observed. It can be interpreted
as a simpler special case of RPCA in which the indices of the outlier corrupted entries are known.
