An advantage of scientific workflow systems is their ability to collect runtime provenance information
as an execution trace. Traces include the computation steps invoked as part of the workflow run along
with the corresponding data consumed and produced by each workflow step. The information captured
by a trace is used to infer "lineage" relationships among data items, which can help answer provenance
queries to find workflow inputs that were involved in producing specific workflow outputs. Determining
lineage relationships, however, requires an understanding of the dependency patterns that exist
between each workflow step's inputs and outputs, and this information is often under-specified
or generally assumed by workflow systems. For instance, most approaches assume all outputs depend
on all inputs, which can lead to lineage "false positives". In prior work, we defined annotations
for specifying detailed dependency relationships between inputs and outputs of computation steps.
These annotations are used to define corresponding rules for inferring fine-grained data dependencies
from a trace. In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the impact of dependency annotations
on workflow specifications. In particular, we provide a reasoning framework to ensure the set of
dependency annotations on a workflow specification is consistent. The framework can also infer
a complete set of annotations given a partially annotated workflow. Finally, we describe an implementation
of the reasoning framework using answer-set programming.
