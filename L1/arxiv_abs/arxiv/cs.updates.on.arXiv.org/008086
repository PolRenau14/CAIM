The theory introduced, presented and developed in this paper, is concerned with an enriched extension
of the theory of Rough Sets pioneered by Zdzislaw Pawlak. The enrichment discussed here is in the
sense of valuated categories as developed by F.W. Lawvere. This paper relates Rough Sets to an abstraction
of the theory of Fuzzy Sets pioneered by Lotfi Zadeh, and provides a natural foundation for "soft
computation". To paraphrase Lotfi Zadeh, the impetus for the transition from a hard theory to a soft
theory derives from the fact that both the generality of a theory and its applicability to real-world
problems are substantially enhanced by replacing various hard concepts with their soft counterparts.
Here we discuss the corresponding enriched notions for indiscernibility, subsets, upper/lower
approximations, and rough sets. Throughout, we indicate linkages with the theory of Formal Concept
Analysis pioneered by Rudolf Wille. We pay particular attention to the all-important notion of
a "linguistic variable" - developing its enriched extension, comparing it with the notion of conceptual
scale from Formal Concept Analysis, and discussing the pragmatic issues of its creation and use
in the interpretation of data. These pragmatic issues are exemplified by the discovery, conceptual
analysis, interpretation, and categorization of networked information resources in WAVE, the
Web Analysis and Visualization Environment currently being developed for the management and interpretation
of the universe of resource information distributed over the World-Wide Web.
