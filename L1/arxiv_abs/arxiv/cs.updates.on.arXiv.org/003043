The Internet of Thing (IoT) has been a hot topic in both research community and industry. It is anticipated
that in future IoT, an enormous number of sensors will collect the physical information every moment
to enable the control center making better decisions to improve the quality of service (QoS). However,
the sensors maybe faulty and thus generate inaccurate data which would compromise the decision
making. To guarantee the QoS, the system should be able to detect faulty sensors so as to eliminate
the damages of inaccurate data. Various faulty sensor detection mechanisms have been developed
in the context of wireless sensor network (WSN). Some of them are only fit for WSN while the others
would bring a communication burden to control center. To detect the faulty sensors for general IoT
applications and save the communication resource at the same time, an efficient faulty sensor detection
scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme takes advantage of fog computing to save the
computation and communication resource of control center. To preserve the privacy of sensor data,
the Paillier Cryptosystem is adopted in the fog computing. The batch verification technique is
applied to achieve efficient authentication. The performance analyses are presented to demonstrate
that the proposed detection scheme is able to conserve the communication resource of control center
and achieve a high true positive ratio while maintaining an acceptable false positive ratio. The
scheme could also withstand various security attacks and preserve data privacy.
