Shifting computing architectures from von Neumann to event-based spiking neural networks (SNNs)
uncovers new opportunities for low-power processing of sensory data in applications such as vision
or sensorimotor control. Exploring roads toward cognitive SNNs requires the design of compact,
low-power and versatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning
in order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However, embedding online
learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred complexity and area overheads. In this work,
we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm$^2$ 64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic
processor in 28nm FDSOI CMOS achieving a minimum energy per synaptic operation (SOP) of 12.7pJ.
It leverages an efficient implementation of the spike-driven synaptic plasticity (SDSP) learning
rule for high-density embedded online learning with only 0.68$\mu$m$^2$ per 4-bit synapse. Neurons
can be independently configured as a standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model or as a custom
phenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in biological spiking
neurons. Using a single presentation of 6k 16$\times$16 MNIST training images to a single-layer
fully-connected 10-neuron network with on-chip SDSP-based learning, ODIN achieves a classification
accuracy of 84.5% while consuming only 15nJ/inference at 0.55V using rank order coding. ODIN thus
enables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for low-power, adaptive
and low-cost processing.
