Computationally efficient matrix multiplication is a fundamental requirement in various fields,
including and particularly in data analytics. To do so, the computation task of a large-scale matrix
multiplication is typically outsourced to multiple servers. However, due to data misusage at the
servers, security is typically of concern. In this paper, we study the two-sided secure matrix multiplication
problem, where a user is interested in the matrix product $\boldsymbol{AB}$ of two finite field
private matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ from an information-theoretic perspective.
In this problem, the user exploits the computational resources of $N$ servers to compute the matrix
product, but simultaneously tries to conceal the private matrices from the servers. Our goal is
twofold: (i) to maximize the communication rate, and, (ii) to minimize the effective number of server
observations needed to determine $\boldsymbol{AB}$, while preserving security, where we allow
for up to $\ell\leq N$ servers to collude. To this end, we propose a general aligned secret sharing
scheme for which we optimize the matrix partition of matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$
in order to either optimize objective (i) or (ii) as a function of the system parameters (e.g., $N$
and $\ell$). A proposed inductive approach gives us analytical, close-to-optimal solutions for
both (i) and (ii). With respect to (i), our scheme significantly outperforms the existing scheme
of Chang and Tandon in terms of (a) communication rate, (b) maximum tolerable number of colluding
servers and (c) computational complexity.
