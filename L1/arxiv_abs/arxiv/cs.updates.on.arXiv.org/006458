A central problem of random matrix theory is to understand the eigenvalues of spiked random matrix
models, introduced by Johnstone, in which a prominent eigenvector (or "spike") is planted into
a random matrix. These distributions form natural statistical models for principal component
analysis (PCA) problems throughout the sciences. Baik, Ben Arous and Peche showed that the spiked
Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp phase transition asymptotically: when the spike strength is
above a critical threshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top eigenvalue,
and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information. Such results form the basis
of our understanding of when PCA can detect a low-rank signal in the presence of noise. However, under
structural assumptions on the spike, not all information is necessarily contained in the spectrum.
We study the statistical limits of tests for the presence of a spike, including non-spectral tests.
Our results leverage Le Cam's notion of contiguity, and include: i) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble,
we show that PCA achieves the optimal detection threshold for certain natural priors for the spike.
ii) For any non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, PCA is sub-optimal for detection. However, an efficient
variant of PCA achieves the optimal threshold (for natural priors) by pre-transforming the matrix
entries. iii) For the Gaussian Wishart ensemble, the PCA threshold is optimal for positive spikes
(for natural priors) but this is not always the case for negative spikes.
