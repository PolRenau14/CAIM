While regulators advocate for higher cloud transparency, many Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
often do not provide detailed information regarding their security implementations in their Service
Level Agreements (SLAs). In practice, CSPs are hesitant to release detailed information regarding
their security posture for security and proprietary reasons. This lack of transparency hinders
the adoption of cloud computing by enterprises and individuals. Unless CSPs share information
regarding the technical details of their security proceedings and standards, customers cannot
verify which cloud provider matched their needs in terms of security and privacy guarantees. To
address this problem, we propose QRES, the first system that enables (a) CSPs to disclose detailed
information about their offered security services in an encrypted form to ensure data confidentiality,
and (b) customers to assess the CSPs' offered security services and find those satisfying their
security requirements. Our system preserves each party's privacy by leveraging a novel evaluation
method based on Secure Two Party Computation (2PC) and Searchable Encryption techniques. We implement
QRES and highlight its usefulness by applying it to existing standardized SLAs. The real world tests
illustrate that the system runs in acceptable time for practical application even when used with
a multitude of CSPs. We formally prove the security requirements of the proposed system against
a strong realistic adversarial model, using an automated cryptographic protocol verifier.
