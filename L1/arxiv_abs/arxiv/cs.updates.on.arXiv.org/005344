The application resource specification--a static specification of several parameters such as
the number of threads and the scratchpad memory usage per thread block--forms a critical component
of modern GPU programming models. This specification determines the parallelism, and hence performance,
of the application during execution because the corresponding on-chip hardware resources are
allocated and managed based on this specification. This tight-coupling between the software-provided
resource specification and resource management in hardware leads to significant challenges in
programming ease, portability, and performance. Zorua is a new resource virtualization framework,
that decouples the programmer-specified resource usage of a GPU application from the actual allocation
in the on-chip hardware resources. Zorua enables this decoupling by virtualizing each resource
transparently to the programmer. We demonstrate that by providing the illusion of more resources
than physically available via controlled and coordinated virtualization, Zorua offers several
important benefits: (i) Programming Ease. Zorua eases the burden on the programmer to provide code
that is tuned to efficiently utilize the physically available on-chip resources. (ii) Portability.
Zorua alleviates the necessity of re-tuning an application's resource usage when porting the application
across GPU generations. (iii) Performance. By dynamically allocating resources and carefully
oversubscribing them when necessary, Zorua improves or retains the performance of applications
that are already highly tuned to best utilize the resources.
