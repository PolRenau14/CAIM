Intelligent fashion outfit composition becomes more and more popular in these years. Some deep
learning based approaches reveal competitive composition recently. However, the unexplainable
characteristic makes such deep learning based approach cannot meet the the designer, businesses
and consumers' urge to comprehend the importance of different attributes in an outfit composition.
To realize interpretable and customized fashion outfit compositions, we propose a partitioned
embedding network to learn interpretable representations from clothing items. The overall network
architecture consists of three components: an auto-encoder module, a supervised attributes module
and a multi-independent module. The auto-encoder module serves to encode all useful information
into the embedding. In the supervised attributes module, multiple attributes labels are adopted
to ensure that different parts of the overall embedding correspond to different attributes. In
the multi-independent module, adversarial operation are adopted to fulfill the mutually independent
constraint. With the interpretable and partitioned embedding, we then construct an outfit composition
graph and an attribute matching map. Given specified attributes description, our model can recommend
a ranked list of outfit composition with interpretable matching scores. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that 1) the partitioned embedding have unmingled parts which corresponding to different
attributes and 2) outfits recommended by our model are more desirable in comparison with the existing
methods.
