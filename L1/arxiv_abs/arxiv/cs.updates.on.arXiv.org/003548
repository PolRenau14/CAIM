In this paper, we proposed a effective but extensible residual one-dimensional convolution neural
network as base network, based on the this network, we proposed four subnets to explore the features
of skeleton sequences from each aspect. Given a skeleton sequences, the spatial information are
encoded into the skeleton joints coordinate in a frame and the temporal information are present
by multiple frames. Limited by the skeleton sequence representations, two-dimensional convolution
neural network cannot be used directly, we chose one-dimensional convolution layer as the basic
layer. Each sub network could extract discriminative features from different aspects. Our first
subnet is a two-stream network which could explore both temporal and spatial information. The second
is a body-parted network, which could gain micro spatial features and macro temporal features.
The third one is an attention network, the main contribution of which is to focus the key frames and
feature channels which high related with the action classes in a skeleton sequence. One frame-difference
network, as the last subnet, mainly processes the joints changes between the consecutive frames.
Four subnets ensemble together by late fusion, the key problem of ensemble method is each subnet
should have a certain performance and between the subnets, there are diversity existing. Each subnet
shares a wellperformance basenet and differences between subnets guaranteed the diversity. Experimental
results show that the ensemble network gets a state-of-the-art performance on three widely used
datasets.
