Disaster management demands a near real-time information dissemina-tion so that the emergency
services can be provided to the right people at the right time. Recent advances in information and
communication technologies enable collection of real-time information from various sources.
For example, sensors deployed in the fields collect data about the environment. Similarly, social
networks like Twitter and Facebook can help to collect data from people in the disaster zone. On one
hand, inadequate situation awareness in disasters has been identified as one of the primary factors
in human errors with grave consequences such as loss of lives and destruction of critical infrastructure.
On the other hand, the growing ubiquity of social media and mobile devices, and pervasive nature
of the Internet-of-Things means that there are more sources of outbound traffic, which ultimately
results in the creation of a data deluge, beginning shortly after the onset of disaster events, leading
to the problem of information tsunami. In addition, security and privacy has crucial role to overcome
the misuse of the system for either intrusions into data or overcome the misuse of the information
that was meant for a specified purpose. .... In this chapter, we provide such a situation aware application
to support disaster management data lifecycle, i.e. from data ingestion and processing to alert
dissemination. We utilize cloud computing, Internet of Things and social computing technologies
to achieve a scalable, effi-cient, and usable situation-aware application called Cloud4BigData.
