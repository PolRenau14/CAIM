We investigate task clustering for deep-learning based multi-task and few-shot learning in a many-task
setting. We propose a new method to measure task similarities with cross-task transfer performance
matrix for the deep learning scenario. Although this matrix provides us critical information regarding
similarity between tasks, its asymmetric property and unreliable performance scores can affect
conventional clustering methods adversely. Additionally, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the
ones with extremely asymmetric transfer scores, may collectively mislead clustering algorithms
to output an inaccurate task-partition. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel task-clustering
algorithm by using the matrix completion technique. The proposed algorithm constructs a partially-observed
similarity matrix based on the certainty of cluster membership of the task-pairs. We then use a matrix
completion algorithm to complete the similarity matrix. Our theoretical analysis shows that under
mild constraints, the proposed algorithm will perfectly recover the underlying "true" similarity
matrix with a high probability. Our results show that the new task clustering method can discover
task clusters for training flexible and superior neural network models in a multi-task learning
setup for sentiment classification and dialog intent classification tasks. Our task clustering
approach also extends metric-based few-shot learning methods to adapt multiple metrics, which
demonstrates empirical advantages when the tasks are diverse.
