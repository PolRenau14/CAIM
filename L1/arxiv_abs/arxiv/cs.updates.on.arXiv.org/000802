In settings with incomplete information, players can find it difficult to coordinate to find states
with good social welfare. For example, in financial settings, if a collection of financial firms
have limited information about each other's strategies, some large number of them may choose the
same high-risk investment in hopes of high returns. While this might be acceptable in some cases,
the economy can be hurt badly if many firms make investments in the same risky market segment and it
fails. One reason why many firms might end up choosing the same segment is that they do not have information
about other firms' investments (imperfect information may lead to `bad' game states). Directly
reporting all players' investments, however, raises confidentiality concerns for both individuals
and institutions. In this paper, we explore whether information about the game-state can be publicly
announced in a manner that maintains the privacy of the actions of the players, and still suffices
to deter players from reaching bad game-states. We show that in many games of interest, it is possible
for players to avoid these bad states with the help of privacy-preserving, publicly-announced
information. We model behavior of players in this imperfect information setting in two ways -- greedy
and undominated strategic behaviours, and we prove guarantees on social welfare that certain kinds
of privacy-preserving information can help attain. Furthermore, we design a counter with improved
privacy guarantees under continual observation.
