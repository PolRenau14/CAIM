Increasing capacity demands in emerging wireless technologies are expected to be met by network
densification and spectrum bands open to multiple technologies. These will, in turn, increase
the level of interference and also result in more complex inter-technology interactions, which
will need to be managed through spectrum sharing mechanisms. Consequently, novel spectrum sharing
mechanisms should be designed to allow spectrum access for multiple technologies, while efficiently
utilizing the spectrum resources overall. Importantly, it is not trivial to design such efficient
mechanisms, not only due to technical aspects, but also due to regulatory and business model constraints.
In this survey we address spectrum sharing mechanisms for wireless inter-technology coexistence
by means of a technology circle that incorporates in a unified, system-level view the technical
and non-technical aspects. We thus systematically explore the spectrum sharing design space consisting
of parameters at different layers. Using this framework, we present a literature review on inter-technology
coexistence with a focus on wireless technologies with equal spectrum access rights, i.e. (i) primary/primary,
(ii) secondary/secondary, and (iii) technologies operating in a spectrum commons. Moreover,
we reflect on our literature review to identify possible spectrum sharing design solutions and
performance evaluation approaches useful for future coexistence cases. Finally, we discuss spectrum
sharing design challenges and suggest future research directions.
