We propose a new arrangement problem on directed graphs, Maximum Directed Linear Arrangement (MaxDLA).
This is a directed variant of a similar problem for undirected graphs, in which however one seeks
maximum and not minimum; this problem known as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem (MinLA) has
been much studied in the literature. We establish a number of theorems illustrating the behavior
and complexity of MaxDLA. First, we relate MaxDLA to Maximum Directed Cut (MaxDiCut) by proving
that every simple digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\frac{n}{2}$$maxDiCut(D) \leq MaxDLA(D)
\leq (n-1)MaxDiCut(D)$. Next, we prove that MaxDiCut is NP-Hard for planar digraphs (even with
the added restriction of maximum degree 15); it follows from the above bounds that MaxDLA is also
NP-Hard for planar digraphs. In contrast, Hadlock (1975) and Dorfman and Orlova (1972) showed that
the undirected Maximum Cut problem is solvable in polynomial time on planar graphs. On the positive
side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MaxDLA on orientations of trees with degree
bounded by a constant, which translates to a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MinLA on the
complements of those trees. This pairs with results by Goldberg and Klipker (1976), Shiloach (1979)
and Chung (1984) solving MinLA in polynomial time on trees. Finally, analogues of Harper's famous
isoperimetric inequality for the hypercube, in the setting of MaxDLA, are shown for tournaments,
orientations of graphs with degree at most two, and transitive acyclic digraphs.
