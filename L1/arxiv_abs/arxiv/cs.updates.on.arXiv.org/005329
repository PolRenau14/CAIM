In this paper, the imbalance edge cloud based computing offloading for multiple mobile users (MUs)
with multiple tasks per MU is studied. In which, several edge cloud servers (ECSs) are shared and
accessed by multiple wireless access points (APs) with the backhaul links, and each MU has multiple
computing intensive and latency critical tasks should be offloaded to execute, which involves
both the AP association and ECS selection, with the objective of minimizing the offloading cost.
Distinguished with existing research, besides the transmission delay and energy consumption
from MU to AP, the ECS access-cost which characterizes the ECS access delay and (or) resource using
cost is introduced, thus finally formulates the delay-energy-cost tradeoff based offloading
cost criteria, for the MUs' offloading decision and resource allocation problems. In specific,
in our system, the ECS access-cost depends on both the AP and ECS, which reflects the effects of different
backhaul techniques used by these APs, and their negotiated payments of ECS resource using under
different service level agreements. Both problems of minimizing the sum offloading costs for all
MUs (efficiency-based) and minimizing the maximal offloading cost per MU (fairness-based) are
discussed. Since these problems are all NP-hard. Therefore, some centralized and distributed
heuristic algorithms are proposed to find the suboptimal solutions. Further analysis and numerical
results are presented at last to demonstrate the performance of these algorithms from several aspects,
such as efficiency, complexity and fairness.
