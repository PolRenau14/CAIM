We consider an abstraction of computational security in password protected systems where a user
draws a secret string of given length with i.i.d. characters from a finite alphabet, and an adversary
would like to identify the secret string by querying, or guessing, the identity of the string. The
concept of a "total entropy budget" on the chosen word by the user is natural, otherwise the chosen
password would have arbitrary length and complexity. One intuitively expects that a password chosen
from the uniform distribution is more secure. This is not the case, however, if we are considering
only the average guesswork of the adversary when the user is subject to a total entropy budget. The
optimality of the uniform distribution for the user's secret string holds when we have also a budget
on the guessing adversary. We suppose that the user is subject to a "total entropy budget" for choosing
the secret string, whereas the computational capability of the adversary is determined by his "total
guesswork budget." We study the regime where the adversary's chances are exponentially small in
guessing the secret string chosen subject to a total entropy budget. We introduce a certain notion
of uniformity and show that a more uniform source will provide better protection against the adversary
in terms of his chances of success in guessing the secret string. In contrast, the average number
of queries that it takes the adversary to identify the secret string is smaller for the more uniform
secret string subject to the same total entropy budget.
