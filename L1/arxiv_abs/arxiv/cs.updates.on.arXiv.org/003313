Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects,
despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural
solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not
well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups.
To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information
from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. In order to study
the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently
solve this task, we consider a noisy version of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which
implies that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication,
no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly
interacting with the sources. Our results thus show an exponential separation between the uniform
PUSH and PULL communication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be interpreted
as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading, a system must exhibit either
some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is
immune to noise. We corroborate our theoretical findings with a new analysis of experimental data
regarding recruitment in Cataglyphis niger desert ants.
