Data in mobile cloud environment are mainly transmitted via wireless noisy channels, which may
result in transmission errors with a high probability due to its unreliable connectivity. For video
transmission, unreliable connectivity may cause significant degradation of the content. Improving
or keeping video quality over lossy channel is therefore a very important research topic. Error
concealment with data hiding (ECDH) is an effective way to conceal the errors introduced by channels.
It can reduce error propagation between neighbor blocks/frames comparing with the methods exploiting
temporal/spatial correlations. The existing video ECDH methods often embed the motion vectors
(MVs) into the specific locations. Nevertheless, specific embedding locations cannot resist
against random errors. To compensate the unreliable connectivity in mobile cloud environment,
in this paper, we present a video ECDH scheme using 3D reversible data hiding (RDH), in which each
MV is repeated multiple times, and the repeated MVs are embedded into different macroblocks (MBs)
randomly. Though the multiple embedding requires more embedding space, satisfactory trade-off
between the introduced distortion and the reconstructed video quality can be achieved by tuning
the repeating times of the MVs. For random embedding, the lost probability of the MVs decreases rapidly,
resulting in better error concealment performance. Experimental results show that the PSNR values
gain about 5dB at least comparing with the existing ECDH methods. Meanwhile, the proposed method
improves the video quality significantly.
