Whole-arm tactile sensing enables a robot to sense contact and infer contact properties across
its entire arm. Within this paper, we demonstrate that using data-driven methods, a humanoid robot
can infer mechanical properties of objects from contact with its forearm during a simple reaching
motion. A key issue is the extent to which the performance of data-driven methods can generalize
to robot actions that differ from those used during training. To investigate this, we developed
an idealized physics-based lumped element model of a robot with a compliant joint making contact
with an object. Using this physics-based model, we performed experiments with varied robot, object
and environment parameters. We also collected data from a tactile-sensing forearm on a real robot
as it made contact with various objects during a simple reaching motion with varied arm velocities
and joint stiffnesses. The robot used one nearest neighbor classifiers (1-NN), hidden Markov models
(HMMs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer two object properties (hard vs. soft
and moved vs. unmoved) based on features of time-varying tactile sensor data (maximum force, contact
area, and contact motion). We found that, in contrast to 1-NN, the performance of LSTMs (with sufficient
data availability) and multivariate HMMs successfully generalized to new robot motions with distinct
velocities and joint stiffnesses. Compared to single features, using multiple features gave the
best results for both experiments with physics-based models and a real-robot.
