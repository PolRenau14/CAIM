Due to technology advancements and circuits miniaturization, the study of logic systems that can
be applied to nanotechnology has been progressing steadily. Among the creation of nanoeletronic
circuits reversible and majority logic stand out. This paper proposes the MPC (Majority Primitives
Combination) algorithm, used for majority logic synthesis. The algorithm receives a truth table
as input and returns a majority function that covers the same set of minterms. The formulation of
a valid output function is made with the combination of previously optimized functions. As cost
criteria the algorithm searches for a function with the least number of levels, followed by the least
number of gates, inverters, and gate inputs. In this paper it's also presented a comparison between
the MPC and the exact_mig, currently considered the best algorithm for majority synthesis. The
exact_mig encode the exact synthesis of majority functions using the number of levels and gates
as cost criteria. The MPC considers two additional cost criteria, the number of inverters and the
number of gate inputs, with the goal to further improve exact_mig results. Tests have shown that
both algorithms return optimal solutions for all functions with 3 input variables. For functions
with 4 inputs, the MPC is able to further improve 42,987 (66%) functions and achieves equal results
for 7,198 (11%). For functions with 5 input variables, out of a sample of 1,000 randomly generated
functions, the MPC further improved 477 (48%) functions and achieved equal results for 112 (11%).
