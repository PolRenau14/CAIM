Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with the aim of extracting
insights related to dynamic behavior. Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home
environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute
to ambient assisted living solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable the application
of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor
as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing).
Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have been shown to enable discovery
of more precise and insightful process models. However, there exists no automated approach to generate
refinements of event labels in the context of process mining. In this paper we propose a framework
for the automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events, allowing
us to distinguish behaviourally different instances of the same event type based on their time attribute.
We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that using automatically generated refined
labels in process discovery, we can find more specific, and therefore more insightful, process
models. We observe that one label refinement could have an effect on the usefulness of other label
refinements when used together. Therefore, we explore four strategies to generate useful combinations
of multiple label refinements and evaluate those on three real life smart home event logs.
