This paper presents SgxPectre Attacks that exploit the recently disclosed CPU bugs to subvert the
confidentiality and integrity of SGX enclaves. Particularly, we show that when branch prediction
of the enclave code can be influenced by programs outside the enclave, the control flow of the enclave
program can be temporarily altered to execute instructions that lead to observable cache-state
changes. An adversary observing such changes can learn secrets inside the enclave memory or its
internal registers, thus completely defeating the confidentiality guarantee offered by SGX.
To demonstrate the practicality of our SgxPectre Attacks, we have systematically explored the
possible attack vectors of branch target injection, approaches to win the race condition during
enclave's speculative execution, and techniques to automatically search for code patterns required
for launching the attacks. Our study suggests that any enclave program could be vulnerable to SgxPectre
Attacks since the desired code patterns are available in most SGX runtimes (e.g., Intel SGX SDK,
Rust-SGX, and Graphene-SGX). Most importantly, we have applied SgxPectre Attacks to steal seal
keys and attestation keys from Intel signed quoting enclaves. The seal key can be used to decrypt
sealed storage outside the enclaves and forge valid sealed data; the attestation key can be used
to forge attestation signatures. For these reasons, SgxPectre Attacks practically defeat SGX's
security protection. This paper also systematically evaluates Intel's existing countermeasures
against SgxPectre Attacks and discusses the security implications.
