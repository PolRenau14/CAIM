Dating and romantic relationships not only play a huge role in our personal lives but also collectively
influence and shape society. Today, many romantic partnerships originate from the Internet, signifying
the importance of technology and the web in modern dating. In this paper, we present a text-based
computational approach for estimating the relationship compatibility of two users on social media.
Unlike many previous works that propose reciprocal recommender systems for online dating websites,
we devise a distant supervision heuristic to obtain real world couples from social platforms such
as Twitter. Our approach, the CoupleNet is an end-to-end deep learning based estimator that analyzes
the social profiles of two users and subsequently performs a similarity match between the users.
Intuitively, our approach performs both user profiling and match-making within a unified end-to-end
framework. CoupleNet utilizes hierarchical recurrent neural models for learning representations
of user profiles and subsequently coupled attention mechanisms to fuse information aggregated
from two users. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first data-driven deep learning
approach for our novel relationship recommendation problem. We benchmark our CoupleNet against
several machine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental results show that our approach
outperforms all approaches significantly in terms of precision. Qualitative analysis shows that
our model is capable of also producing explainable results to users.
