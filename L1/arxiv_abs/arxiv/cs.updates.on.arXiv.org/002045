Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging technique that allows one to
measure tissue perfusion in an organ of interest through the injection of an intravascular paramagnetic
contrast agent (CA). Due to a preference for high temporal and spatial resolution in many applications,
this modality could significantly benefit from accelerated data acquisitions. In this paper,
we specifically address the problem of reconstructing perfusion MR image series from a subset of
k-space data. Our proposed approach is motivated by the observation that temporal variations (dynamics)
in perfusion imaging often exhibit correlation across different spatial scales. Hence, we propose
a model that jointly penalizes the voxel-wise deviations in temporal gradient images obtained
based on a baseline, and the patch-wise dissimilarities between the spatio-temporal neighborhoods
of entire image sequence. We validate our method on dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI
and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI brain perfusion datasets acquired from 10 tumor patients
in total. We provide extensive analysis of reconstruction performance and perfusion parameter
estimation in comparison to state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. Experimental results
on clinical datasets demonstrate that our reconstruction model can potentially achieve up to 8-fold
acceleration by enabling accurate estimation of perfusion parameters while preserving spatial
image details and reconstructing the complete perfusion time-intensity curves (TICs).
