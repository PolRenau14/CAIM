Algorithmic issues concerning Elliott local semigroups are seldom considered in the literature,
although these combinatorial structures completely classify AF algebras. In general, the addition
operation of an Elliott local semigroup is {\it partial}, but for every AF algebra $\mathfrak B$
whose Murray-von Neumann order of projections is a lattice, this operation is uniquely extendible
to the addition of an involutive monoid $E(\mathfrak B)$. Let $\mathfrak M_1$ be the Farey AF algebra
introduced by the present author in 1988 and rediscovered by F. Boca in 2008. The freeness properties
of the involutive monoid $E(\mathfrak M_1)$ yield a natural word problem for every AF algebra $\mathfrak
B$ with singly generated $E(\mathfrak B)$, because $\mathfrak B$ is automatically a quotient of
$\mathfrak M_1$. Given two formulas $\phi$ and $\psi$ in the language of involutive monoids, the
problem asks to decide whether $\phi$ and $\psi$ code the same equivalence of projections of $\mathfrak
B$. This mimics the classical definition of the word problem of a group presented by generators and
relations. We show that the word problem of $\mathfrak M_1$ is solvable in polynomial time, and so
is the word problem of the Behnke-Leptin algebras $\mathcal A_{n,k}$, and of the Effros-Shen algebras
$\mathfrak F_{\theta}$, for $\theta\in [0,1]\setminus \mathbb Q$ a real algebraic number, or
$\theta = 1/e$. We construct a quotient of $\mathfrak M_1$ having a G\"odel incomplete word problem,
and show that no primitive quotient of $\mathfrak M_1$ is G\"odel incomplete.
