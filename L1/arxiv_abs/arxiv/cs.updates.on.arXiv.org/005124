The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoTs) allows heterogeneous embedded smart devices to collaboratively
provide smart services with or without human intervention. While leveraging the large scale IoT
based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoTs also incur more concerns on privacy and
security. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face, access authorization is critical in
resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses in today's access control (AC)
is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single
point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain enabled decentralized capability based
AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes
to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network,
a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity
based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of smart contract
for registering, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC
scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised
by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private
blockchain network, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC
approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine grained AC solution to IoT systems.
