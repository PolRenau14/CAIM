Ji\v{r}\'i Matou\v{s}ek (1963-2015) had many breakthrough contributions in mathematics and
algorithm design. His milestone results are not only profound but also elegant. By going beyond
the original objects --- such as Euclidean spaces or linear programs --- Jirka found the essence
of the challenging mathematical/algorithmic problems as well as beautiful solutions that were
natural to him, but were surprising discoveries to the field. In this short exploration article,
I will first share with readers my initial encounter with Jirka and discuss one of his fundamental
geometric results from the early 1990s. In the age of social and information networks, I will then
turn the discussion from geometric structures to network structures, attempting to take a humble
step towards the holy grail of network science, that is to understand the network essence that underlies
the observed sparse-and-multifaceted network data. I will discuss a simple result which summarizes
some basic algebraic properties of personalized PageRank matrices. Unlike the traditional transitive
closure of binary relations, the personalized PageRank matrices take "accumulated Markovian
closure" of network data. Some of these algebraic properties are known in various contexts. But
I hope featuring them together in a broader context will help to illustrate the desirable properties
of this Markovian completion of networks, and motivate systematic developments of a network theory
for understanding vast and ubiquitous multifaceted network data.
