One fundamental issue in managing bike sharing systems is the bike flow prediction. Due to the hardness
of predicting the flow for a single station, recent research works often predict the bike flow at
cluster-level. While such studies gain satisfactory prediction accuracy, they cannot directly
guide some fine-grained bike sharing system management issues at station-level. In this paper,
we revisit the problem of the station-level bike flow prediction, aiming to boost the prediction
accuracy leveraging the breakthroughs of deep learning techniques. We propose a new multi-graph
convolutional neural network model to predict the bike flow at station-level, where the key novelty
is viewing the bike sharing system from the graph perspective. More specifically, we construct
multiple inter-station graphs for a bike sharing system. In each graph, nodes are stations, and
edges are a certain type of relations between stations. Then, multiple graphs are constructed to
reflect heterogeneous relationships (e.g., distance, ride record correlation). Afterward,
we fuse the multiple graphs and then apply the convolutional layers on the fused graph to predict
station-level future bike flow. In addition to the estimated bike flow value, our model also gives
the prediction confidence interval so as to help the bike sharing system managers make decisions.
Using New York City and Chicago bike sharing data for experiments, our model can outperform state-of-the-art
station-level prediction models by reducing 25.1% and 17.0% of prediction error in New York City
and Chicago, respectively.
