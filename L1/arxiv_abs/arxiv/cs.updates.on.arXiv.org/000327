Population-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely applied to solve various optimization
problems. The question of how the performance of a population-based EA depends on the population
size arises naturally. The performance of an EA may be evaluated by different measures, such as the
average convergence rate to the optimal set per generation or the expected number of generations
to encounter an optimal solution for the first time. Population scalability is the performance
ratio between a benchmark EA and another EA using identical genetic operators but a larger population
size. Although intuitively the performance of an EA may improve if its population size increases,
currently there exist only a few case studies for simple fitness functions. This paper aims at providing
a general study for discrete optimisation. A novel approach is introduced to analyse population
scalability using the fundamental matrix. The following two contributions summarize the major
results of the current article. (1) We demonstrate rigorously that for elitist EAs with identical
global mutation, using a lager population size always increases the average rate of convergence
to the optimal set; and yet, sometimes, the expected number of generations needed to find an optimal
solution (measured by either the maximal value or the average value) may increase, rather than decrease.
(2) We establish sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the superlinear scalability, that
is, when the average convergence rate of a $(\mu+\mu)$ EA (where $\mu\ge2$) is bigger than $\mu$
times that of a $(1+1)$ EA.
