Automated music playlist continuation is a common task of music recommender systems, that generally
consists in providing a fitting extension to a given playlist. Collaborative filtering models,
that extract abstract patterns from curated music playlists, tend to provide better playlist continuations
than content-based approaches. However, pure collaborative filtering models have at least one
of the following limitations: (1) they can only extend playlists profiled at training time; (2)
they misrepresent songs that occur in very few playlists. We introduce a novel hybrid playlist continuation
model based on what we name "playlist-song membership", that is, whether a given playlist and a given
song fit together. The proposed model regards any playlist-song pair exclusively in terms of feature
vectors. In light of this information, and after having been trained on a collection of labeled playlist-song
pairs, the proposed model decides whether a playlist-song pair fits together or not. Experimental
results on two datasets of curated music playlists show that the proposed playlist continuation
model compares to a state-of-the-art collaborative filtering model in the ideal situation of extending
playlists profiled at training time and where songs occurred frequently in training playlists.
In contrast to the collaborative filtering model, and as a result of its general understanding of
the playlist-song pairs in terms of feature vectors, the proposed model is additionally able to
(1) extend non-profiled playlists and (2) recommend songs that occurred seldom or never in training~playlists.
