Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicity,
therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various types of chemical analyses, computational
approaches are often required due to the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable
growth and outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research attention.
However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep learning continues to be used only
as a classifier, although deep learning is capable of not only simple classification but also automated
feature extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for CCI, named
DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES),
which is a string notation representing the chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted
features. To discover hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous interaction, we apply
model sharing and hidden representation merging techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared
with a plain deep classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI showed
the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition, the commutative property
was experimentally validated. The automatically extracted features through end-to-end SMILES
learning alleviates the significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected
to improve prediction performance, in drug analyses.
