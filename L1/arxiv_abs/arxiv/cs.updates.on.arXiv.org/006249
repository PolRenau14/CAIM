Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) configure and handle resource allocation (bandwidth, LSPs,
fiber) in networks in general (IP/MPLS/DS-TE, optical domain, other). BAMs currently available
for IP/MPLS/DS-TE networks (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing) basically define resource restrictions
(bandwidth) by class (traffic class, application class, user class or other grouping criteria)
and allocate on demand this resource. There is a BAM allocation policy inherent for each existing
model which behaves differently under distinct network state, such as heavy traffic loads and dynamic
traffic and/or application scenarios. A generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM) is proposed
in this paper. G-BAM, firstly, incorporates the inherent behavior of currently used BAMs such as
MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing in IP/MPLS/DS-TE context. G-BAM, secondly, proposes a new
policy/ behavior allocation in addition to existing ones in which additional private resources
are incorporated. G-BAM, thirdly, allows a smoother BAM policy transition among existing policy
alternatives resulting from MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing adoption independently. The paper focuses
on the first characteristics of G-BAM which is to reproduce MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors.
As such, the required configuration to achieve MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors is presented
followed by a proof of concept. Authors argue that the G-BAM reproducibility characteristics may
improve overall network resource utilization under distinct traffic profiles.
