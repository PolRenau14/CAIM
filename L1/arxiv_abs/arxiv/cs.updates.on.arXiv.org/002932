Counting the number of people inside a building, from outside and without entering the building,
is crucial for many applications. In this paper, we are interested in counting the total number of
people walking inside a building (or in general behind walls), using readily-deployable WiFi transceivers
that are installed outside the building, and only based on WiFi RSSI measurements. The key observation
of the paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to the dip events of the received signal,
are fairly robust to the attenuation through walls (for instance as compared to the exact dip values).
We then propose a methodology that can extract the total number of people from the inter-event times.
More specifically, we first show how to characterize the wireless received power measurements
as a superposition of renewal-type processes. By borrowing theories from the renewal-process
literature, we then show how the probability mass function of the inter-event times carries vital
information on the number of people. We validate our framework with 44 experiments in five different
areas on our campus (3 classrooms, a conference room, and a hallway), using only one WiFi transmitter
and receiver installed outside of the building, and for up to and including 20 people. Our experiments
further include areas with different wall materials, such as concrete, plaster, and wood, to validate
the robustness of the proposed approach. Overall, our results show that our approach can estimate
the total number of people behind the walls with a high accuracy while minimizing the need for prior
calibrations.
