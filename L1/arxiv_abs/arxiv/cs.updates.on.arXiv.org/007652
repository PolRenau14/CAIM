A method for automatically quantifying emphysema regions using High-Resolution Computed Tomography
(HRCT) scans of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that does not require
manually annotated scans for training is presented. HRCT scans of controls and of COPD patients
with diverse disease severity are acquired at two different centers. Textural features from co-occurrence
matrices and Gaussian filter banks are used to characterize the lung parenchyma in the scans. Two
robust versions of multiple instance learning (MIL) classifiers, miSVM and MILES, are investigated.
The classifiers are trained with the weak labels extracted from the forced expiratory volume in
one minute (FEV$_1$) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). At test time,
the classifiers output a patient label indicating overall COPD diagnosis and local labels indicating
the presence of emphysema. The classifier performance is compared with manual annotations by two
radiologists, a classical density based method, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The miSVM
classifier performed better than MILES on both patient and emphysema classification. The classifier
has a stronger correlation with PFT than the density based method, the percentage of emphysema in
the intersection of annotations from both radiologists, and the percentage of emphysema annotated
by one of the radiologists. The correlation between the classifier and the PFT is only outperformed
by the second radiologist. The method is therefore promising for facilitating assessment of emphysema
and reducing inter-observer variability.
