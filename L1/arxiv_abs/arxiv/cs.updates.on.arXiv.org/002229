We present theoretical analysis and a suite of tests and procedures for addressing a broad class
of redundant and misleading association rules we call \emph{specious rules}. Specious dependencies,
also known as \emph{spurious}, \emph{apparent}, or \emph{illusory associations}, refer to a
well-known phenomenon where marginal dependencies are merely products of interactions with other
variables and disappear when conditioned on those variables. The most extreme example is Yule-Simpson's
paradox where two variables present positive dependence in the marginal contingency table but
negative in all partial tables defined by different levels of a confounding factor. It is accepted
wisdom that in data of any nontrivial dimensionality it is infeasible to control for all of the exponentially
many possible confounds of this nature. In this paper, we consider the problem of specious dependencies
in the context of statistical association rule mining. We define specious rules and show they offer
a unifying framework which covers many types of previously proposed redundant or misleading association
rules. After theoretical analysis, we introduce practical algorithms for detecting and pruning
out specious association rules efficiently under many key goodness measures, including mutual
information and exact hypergeometric probabilities. We demonstrate that the procedure greatly
reduces the number of associations discovered, providing an elegant and effective solution to
the problem of association mining discovering large numbers of misleading and redundant rules.
