The art gallery problem enquires about the least number of guards sufficient to ensure that an art
gallery, represented by a simple polygon $P$, is fully guarded. Most standard versions of this problem
are known to be NP-hard. In 1987, Ghosh provided a deterministic $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for the case of vertex guards and edge guards in simple polygons. In the same paper, Ghosh
also conjectured the existence of constant ratio approximation algorithms for these problems.
We present here three polynomial-time algorithms with a constant approximation ratio for guarding
an $n$-sided simple polygon $P$ using vertex guards. (i) The first algorithm, that has an approximation
ratio of 18, guards all vertices of $P$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ time. (ii) The second algorithm, that
has the same approximation ratio of 18, guards the entire boundary of $P$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$
time. (iii) The third algorithm, that has an approximation ratio of 27, guards all interior and boundary
points of $P$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ time. Further, these algorithms can be modified to obtain similar
approximation ratios while using edge guards. The significance of our results lies in the fact that
these results settle the conjecture by Ghosh regarding the existence of constant-factor approximation
algorithms for this problem, which has been open since 1987 despite several attempts by researchers.
Our approximation algorithms exploit several deep visibility structures of simple polygons which
are interesting in their own right.
