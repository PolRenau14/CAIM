In this paper, the problem of random access contention between machine type devices (MTDs) in the
uplink of a wireless cellular network is studied. In particular, the possibility of forming cooperative
groups to coordinate the MTDs' requests for the random access channel (RACH) is analyzed. The problem
is formulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the players that seek
to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function that captures each MTD's energy consumption
and time-varying queue length. Within each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends
the access requests of the coalition members over the RACH. One key feature of this game is its ability
to cope with stochastic environments in which the arrival requests of MTDs and the packet success
rate over RACH are dynamically time-varying. The proposed stochastic coalitional is composed
of multiple stages, each of which corresponds to a coalitional game in stochastic characteristic
form that is played by the MTDs at each time step. To solve this game, a novel distributed coalition
formation algorithm is proposed and shown to converge to a stable MTD partition. Simulation results
show that, on the average, the proposed stochastic coalition formation algorithm can reduce the
average fail ratio and energy consumption of up to 36% and 31% for a cluster-based distribution of
MTDs, respectively, compared with a noncooperative case. Moreover, when the MTDs are more sensitive
to the energy consumption (queue length), the coalitions' size will increase (decrease).
