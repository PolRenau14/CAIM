Salient Contributions is reproduced below. Salient Contributions The research presents the following
salient contributions: i. A novel technique has been developed for comparing biographical information,
by combining the average impact of Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, and editor distances. The
impact is calculated as the ratio of the edit distance to the maximum possible edit distance between
two strings of the same lengths as the given pair of strings. This impact lies in the range [0, 1] and
can easily be converted to a similarity (matching) score by subtracting the impact from unity. ii.
A universal soft computing framework is proposed for adaptively fusing biometric and biographical
information by making real-time decisions to determine after consideration of each individual
identifier whether computation of matching scores and subsequent fusion of additional identifiers,
including biographical information is required. This proposed framework not only improves the
accuracy of the system by fusing less reliable information (e.g. biographical information) only
for instances where such a fusion is required, but also improves the efficiency of the system by computing
matching scores for various available identifiers only when this computation is considered necessary.
iii. A scientific method for comparing efficiency of fusion strategies through a predicted effort
to error trade-off curve.
