AsterixDB is a new, full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a feature set that distinguishes
it from other platforms in today's open source Big Data ecosystem. Its features make it well-suited
to applications like web data warehousing, social data storage and analysis, and other use cases
related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexible NoSQL style data model; a query language that supports
a wide range of queries; a scalable runtime; partitioned, LSM-based data storage and indexing (including
B+-tree, R-tree, and text indexes); support for external as well as natively stored data; a rich
set of built-in types; support for fuzzy, spatial, and temporal types and queries; a built-in notion
of data feeds for ingestion of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store. Development
of AsterixDB began in 2009 and led to a mid-2013 initial open source release. This paper is the first
complete description of the resulting open source AsterixDB system. Covered herein are the system's
data model, its query language, and its software architecture. Also included are a summary of the
current status of the project and a first glimpse into how AsterixDB performs when compared to alternative
technologies, including a parallel relational DBMS, a popular NoSQL store, and a popular Hadoop-based
SQL data analytics platform, for things that both technologies can do. Also included is a brief description
of some initial trials that the system has undergone and the lessons learned (and plans laid) based
on those early "customer" engagements.
