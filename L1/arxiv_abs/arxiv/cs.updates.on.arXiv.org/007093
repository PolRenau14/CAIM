We consider a communication problem in which an update of the source message needs to be conveyed
to one or more distant receivers that are interested in maintaining specific linear functions of
the source message. The setting is one in which the updates are sparse in nature, and where neither
the source nor the receiver(s) is aware of the exact {\em difference vector}, but only know the amount
of sparsity that is present in the difference-vector. Under this setting, we are interested in devising
linear encoding and decoding schemes that minimize the communication cost involved. We show that
the optimal solution to this problem is closely related to the notion of maximally recoverable codes
(MRCs), which were originally introduced in the context of coding for storage systems. In the context
of storage, MRCs guarantee optimal erasure protection when the system is partially constrained
to have local parity relations among the storage nodes. In our problem, we show that optimal solutions
exist if and only if MRCs of certain kind (identified by the desired linear functions) exist. We consider
point-to-point and broadcast versions of the problem, and identify connections to MRCs under both
these settings. For the point-to-point setting, we show that our linear-encoder based achievable
scheme is optimal even when non-linear encoding is permitted. The theory is illustrated in the context
of updating erasure coded storage nodes. We present examples based on modern storage codes such
as the minimum bandwidth regenerating codes.
