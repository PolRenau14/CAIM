We study the deterministic and randomized query complexity of finding approximate equilibria
in bimatrix games. We show that the deterministic query complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibrium when $\epsilon < \frac{1}{2}$ is $\Omega(k^2)$, even in zero-one constant-sum
games. In combination with previous results \cite{FGGS13}, this provides a complete characterization
of the deterministic query complexity of approximate Nash equilibria. We also study randomized
querying algorithms. We give a randomized algorithm for finding a $(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + \epsilon)$-Nash
equilibrium using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log k}{\epsilon^2})$ payoff queries, which shows that the
$\frac{1}{2}$ barrier for deterministic algorithms can be broken by randomization. For well-supported
Nash equilibria (WSNE), we first give a randomized algorithm for finding an $\epsilon$-WSNE of
a zero-sum bimatrix game using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log k}{\epsilon^4})$ payoff queries, and we then
use this to obtain a randomized algorithm for finding a $(\frac{2}{3} + \epsilon)$-WSNE in a general
bimatrix game using $O(\frac{k \cdot \log k}{\epsilon^4})$ payoff queries. Finally, we initiate
the study of lower bounds against randomized algorithms in the context of bimatrix games, by showing
that randomized algorithms require $\Omega(k^2)$ payoff queries in order to find a $\frac{1}{6k}$-Nash
equilibrium, even in zero-one constant-sum games. In particular, this rules out query-efficient
randomized algorithms for finding exact Nash equilibria.
