This paper employs a weighted network approach to study the empirical properties of the web of trade
relationships among world countries, and its evolution over time. We show that most countries are
characterized by weak trade links; yet, there exists a group of countries featuring a large number
of strong relationships, thus hinting to a core-periphery structure. The World Trade Web (WTW)
is characterized by the following representation: a directed graph connecting world Countries
with trade relationships, with the aim of finding its topological characterization in terms of
motifs and isolating the key factors underlying its evolution. Frequent patterns can identify
channels or infrastructures to be strengthened and can help in choosing the most suitable message
routing schema or network protocol. In general, frequent patterns have been called {\it motifs}
and overrepresented motifs have been recognized to be the low-level building blocks of networks
and to be useful to explain many of their properties, playing a relevant role in determining their
dynamic and evolution. In this paper triadic motifs are found first partitioning a network by strength
of connections and then analyzing the partitions separately. The WTW has been split based on the
weights of the graph to highlight structural differences between the big players in terms of volumes
of trade and the rest of the world. As test case, the period 2003-2010 has been analyzed, to show the
structural effect of the economical crisis in the year 2007.
