We study the bisimilarity problem for probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) and subclasses thereof.
Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, generalising
the classical notion of pushdown automata (without epsilon-transitions). We first show a general
characterization of probabilistic bisimilarity in terms of two-player games, which naturally
reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled transition systems to checking bisimilarity
of standard (non-deterministic) labelled transition systems. This reduction can be easily implemented
in the framework of pPDA, allowing to use known results for standard (non-probabilistic) PDA and
their subclasses. A direct use of the reduction incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which
does not matter in deriving decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA due to the non-elementary complexity
of the problem. In the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (pOCA), of probabilistic visibly
pushdown automata (pvPDA), and of probabilistic basic process algebras (i.e., single-state pPDA)
we show that an implicit use of the reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get PSPACE,
EXPTIME, and 2-EXPTIME upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic
versions. The bisimilarity problems for OCA and vPDA are known to have matching lower bounds (thus
being PSPACE-complete and EXPTIME-complete, respectively); we show that these lower bounds also
hold for fully probabilistic versions that do not use non-determinism.
