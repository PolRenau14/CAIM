In a self-organizing particle system, an abstraction of programmable matter, simple computational
elements called particles with limited memory and communication self-organize to solve system-wide
problems of movement, coordination, and configuration. In this paper, we consider stochastic,
distributed, local, asynchronous algorithms for "shortcut bridging", in which particles self-assemble
bridges over gaps that simultaneously balance minimizing the length and cost of the bridge. Army
ants of the genus Eciton have been observed exhibiting a similar behavior in their foraging trails,
dynamically adjusting their bridges to satisfy an efficiency tradeoff using local interactions.
Using techniques from Markov chain analysis, we rigorously analyze our algorithm, show it achieves
a near-optimal balance between the competing factors of path length and bridge cost, and prove that
it exhibits a dependence on the angle of the gap being "shortcut" similar to that of the ant bridges.
We also present simulation results that qualitatively compare our algorithm with the army ant bridging
behavior. Our work presents a plausible explanation of how convergence to globally optimal configurations
can be achieved via local interactions by simple organisms (e.g., ants) with some limited computational
power and access to random bits. The proposed algorithm demonstrates the robustness of the stochastic
approach to algorithms for programmable matter, as it is a surprisingly simple extension of a stochastic
algorithm for compression.
