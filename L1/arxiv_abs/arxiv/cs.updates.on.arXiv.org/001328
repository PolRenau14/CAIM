The modern engineering landscape increasingly requires a range of skills to successfully integrate
complex systems. Project-based learning is used to help students build professional skills. However,
it is typically applied to small teams and small efforts. This paper describes an experience in engaging
a large number of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary research
effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in Computer Science (embedded
systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical Engineering (circuit design, wireless communications,
hardware prototyping), and Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication).
While a student project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires interaction with
at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long projects have been completed. The students
were a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
and Electrical Engineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate student
learning are real-world system development constraints, regular cross-group meetings, and extensive
involvement of Ph.D. students in student mentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches,
a survey was conducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the approaches. For example, 70% of the students surveyed indicated that working on their research
project improved their ability to function on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships,
or any other activity.
