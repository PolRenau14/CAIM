Tasks such as social network analysis, human behavior recognition, or modeling biochemical reactions,
can be solved elegantly by using the probabilistic inference framework. However, standard probabilistic
inference algorithms work at a propositional level, and thus cannot capture the symmetries and
redundancies that are present in these tasks. Algorithms that exploit those symmetries have been
devised in different research fields, for example by the lifted inference-, multiple object tracking-,
and modeling and simulation-communities. The common idea, that we call state space abstraction,
is to perform inference over compact representations of sets of symmetric states. Although they
are concerned with a similar topic, the relationship between these approaches has not been investigated
systematically. This survey provides the following contributions. We perform a systematic literature
review to outline the state of the art in probabilistic inference methods exploiting symmetries.
From an initial set of more than 4,000 papers, we identify 116 relevant papers. Furthermore, we provide
new high-level categories that classify the approaches, based on the problem classes the different
approaches can solve. Researchers from different fields that are confronted with a state space
explosion problem in a probabilistic system can use this classification to identify possible solutions.
Finally, based on this conceptualization, we identify potentials for future research, as some
relevant application domains are not addressed by current approaches.
