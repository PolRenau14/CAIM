In this paper, a general cognitive radio system consisting of a set of users with different level
of spectrum access including two primary transceivers and several types of secondary users is considered.
It is assumed that two secondary users operate based on an underlay model at the same frequency bandwidth
and at the same time as the primary users based on a multiple access broadcast channel (MABC) bidirectional
beamforming scheme. Other secondary users provide a relaying service to the primary users in exchange
for the opportunity to send their messages towards their own destinations for a fixed portion of
the communication cycle. In addition, it is assumed that some interferers are active during the
communication cycle and cause interference for the network. Furthermore, it is assumed that only
partial channel state information (CSI) between interferers and other nodes in the network is available.
We provide a robust optimization method against imperfection on the interferers' CSI to maximize
the joint primary and secondary {signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)} with the
assumption of limited available power at the secondary relays. An amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
scheme is deployed at the secondary relays and the optimal beamforming is obtained using second
order convex programming (SOCP) method. The simulation results show the performance of the proposed
beamforming method against the existence of interferers, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
our robust method against uncertainty in knowledge of interferers' CSIs.
