Impairments in gait occur after alcohol consumption, and, if detected in real-time, could guide
the delivery of "just-in-time" injury prevention interventions. We aimed to identify the salient
features of gait that could be used for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) level in a typical
drinking environment. We recruited 10 young adults with a history of heavy drinking to test our research
app. During four consecutive Fridays and Saturdays, every hour from 8pm to 12am, they were prompted
to use the app to report alcohol consumption and complete a 5-step straight-line walking task, during
which 3-axis acceleration and angular velocity data was sampled at a frequency of 100 Hz. BAC for
each subject was calculated. From sensor signals, 24 features were calculated using a sliding window
technique, including energy, mean, and standard deviation. Using an artificial neural network
(ANN), we performed regression analysis to define a model determining association between gait
features and BACs. 70\% of data was used as a training dataset, and the results were tested and validated
using the rest of samples. We evaluated different training algorithms for the neural network and
the result showed that a Bayesian regularization neural network (BRNN) was the most efficient and
accurate. Analyses support the use of the tandem gait task paired with our approach to reliably estimate
BAC based on gait features. Results from this work could be useful in designing effective prevention
interventions to reduce risky behaviors during periods of alcohol consumption.
