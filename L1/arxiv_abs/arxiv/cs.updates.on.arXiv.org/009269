Beam training in dynamic millimeter-wave (mm-wave) networks with mobile devices is highly challenging
as devices must scan a large angular domain to maintain alignment of their directional antennas
under mobility. Device rotation is particularly challenging, as a handheld device may rotate significantly
over a very short period of time, causing it to lose the connection to the Access Point (AP) unless
the rotation is accompanied by immediate beam realignment. We study how to maintain the link to a
mm-wave AP under rotation and without any input from inertial sensors, exploiting the fact that
mm-wave devices will typically be multi-band. We present a model that maps Time-of-Flight measurements
to rotation and propose a method to infer the rotation speed of the mobile terminal using only measurements
from sub-6 GHz WiFi. We also use the same sub-6 GHz WiFi system to reduce the angle error estimate for
link establishment, exploiting the spatial geometry of the deployed APs and a statistical model
that maps the user position's spatial distribution to an angle error distribution. We leverage
these findings to introduce SLASH, a Statistical Location and rotation-Aware beam SearcH algorithm
that adaptively narrows the sector search space and accelerates both link establishment and maintenance
between mm-wave devices. We evaluate SLASH with experiments conducted indoors with a sub-6 GHz
WiFi Time-of-Flight positioning system and a 60-GHz testbed. SLASH can increase the data rate by
more than 41% for link establishment and 67% for link maintenance with respect to prior work.
