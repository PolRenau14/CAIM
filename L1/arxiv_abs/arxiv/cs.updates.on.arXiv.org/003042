The variability of the clusters generated by clustering techniques in the domain of latitude and
longitude variables of fatal crash data are significantly unpredictable. This unpredictability,
caused by the randomness of fatal crash incidents, reduces the accuracy of crash frequency (i.e.,
counts of fatal crashes per cluster) which is used to measure traffic safety in practice. In this
paper, a quantitative measure of traffic safety that is not significantly affected by the aforementioned
variability is proposed. It introduces a fatal point -- a segment with the highest frequency of fatality
-- concept based on cluster characteristics and detects them by imposing rounding errors to the
hundredth decimal place of the longitude. The frequencies of the cluster and the cluster's fatal
point are combined to construct a low-sensitive quantitative measure of traffic safety for the
cluster. The performance of the proposed measure of traffic safety is then studied by varying the
parameter k of k-means clustering with the expectation that other clustering techniques can be
adopted in a similar fashion. The 2015 North Carolina fatal crash dataset of Fatality Analysis Reporting
System (FARS) is used to evaluate the proposed fatal point concept and perform experimental analysis
to determine the effectiveness of the proposed measure. The empirical study shows that the average
traffic safety, measured by the proposed quantitative measure over several clusters, is not significantly
affected by the variability, compared to that of the standard crash frequency.
