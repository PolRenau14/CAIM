Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental
conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current
challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex,
distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more
unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems
are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements),
our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems' contextual
requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine
the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of
our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements,
as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing
self-adaptive systems' engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we
perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in
the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated
environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation
results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software
system domains.
