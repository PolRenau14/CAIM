In this paper, we present "FabSearch", a prototype search engine for sourcing manufacturer service
providers, by making use of the product manufacturing information contained within a 3D digital
file of a product. FabSearch is designed to take in a query 3D model, such as the .STEP file of a part
model which then produces a ranked list of job shop service providers who are best suited to fabricate
the part. Service providers may have potentially built hundreds to thousands of parts with associated
part 3D models over time. FabSearch assumes that these service providers have shared shape signatures
of the part models built previously to enable the algorithm to most effectively rank the service
providers who have the most experience to build the query part model. FabSearch has two important
features that helps it produce relevant results. First, it makes use of the shape characteristics
of the 3D part by calculating the Spherical Harmonics signature of the part to calculate the most
similar shapes built previously be job shop service providers. Second, FabSearch utilizes meta-data
about each part, such as material specification, tolerance requirements to help improve the search
results based on the specific query model requirements. The algorithm is tested against a repository
containing more than 2000 models distributed across various job shop service providers. For the
first time, we show the potential for utilizing the rich information contained within a 3D part model
to automate the sourcing and eventual selection of manufacturing service providers.
