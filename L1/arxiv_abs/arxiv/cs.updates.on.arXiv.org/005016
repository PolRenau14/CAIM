Contextualisation has proven to be effective in tailoring \linebreak search results towards the
users' information need. While this is true for a basic query search, the usage of contextual session
information during exploratory search especially on the level of browsing has so far been underexposed
in research. In this paper, we present two approaches that contextualise browsing on the level of
structured metadata in a Digital Library (DL), (1) one variant bases on document similarity and
(2) one variant utilises implicit session information, such as queries and different document
metadata encountered during the session of a users. We evaluate our approaches in a living lab environment
using a DL in the social sciences and compare our contextualisation approaches against a non-contextualised
approach. For a period of more than three months we analysed 47,444 unique retrieval sessions that
contain search activities on the level of browsing. Our results show that a contextualisation of
browsing significantly outperforms our baseline in terms of the position of the first clicked item
in the result set. The mean rank of the first clicked document (measured as mean first relevant - MFR)
was 4.52 using a non-contextualised ranking compared to 3.04 when re-ranking the result lists based
on similarity to the previously viewed document. Furthermore, we observed that both contextual
approaches show a noticeably higher click-through rate. A contextualisation based on document
similarity leads to almost twice as many document views compared to the non-contextualised ranking.
