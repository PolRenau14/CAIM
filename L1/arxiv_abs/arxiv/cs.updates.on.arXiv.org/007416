As sensing technology proliferates and becomes affordable to the general public, there is a growing
trend in citizen science where scientists and volunteers form a strong partnership in conducting
scientific research including problem finding, data collection, analysis, visualization, and
storytelling. Providing easy-to-use computational tools to support citizen science has become
an important issue. To raise the public awareness of environmental science and improve the air quality
in local areas, we are currently collaborating with a local community in monitoring and documenting
fugitive emissions from a coke refinery. We have helped the community members build a live camera
system which captures and visualizes high resolution timelapse imagery starting from November
2014. However, searching and documenting smoke emissions manually from all video frames requires
manpower and takes an impractical investment of time. This paper describes a software tool which
integrates four features: (1) an algorithm based on change detection and texture segmentation
for identifying smoke emissions; (2) an interactive timeline visualization providing indicators
for seeking to interesting events; (3) an autonomous fast-forwarding mode for skipping uninteresting
timelapse frames; and (4) a collection of animated smoke images generated automatically according
to the algorithm for documentation, presentation, storytelling, and sharing. With the help of
this tool, citizen scientists can now focus on the content of the story instead of time-consuming
and laborious works.
