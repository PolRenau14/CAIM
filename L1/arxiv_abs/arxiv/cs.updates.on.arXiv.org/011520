Docker container virtualization technology is being widely adopted in cloud computing environments
because of its lightweight and effiency. However, it requires adequate control and management
via an orchestrator. As a result, cloud providers are adopting the open-access Kubernetes platform
as the standard orchestrator of containerized applications. To ensure applications' availability
in Kubernetes, the latter uses Raft protocol's replication mechanism. Despite its simplicity,
Raft assumes that machines fail only when shutdown. This failure event is rarely the only reason
for a machine's malfunction. Indeed, software errors or malicious attacks can cause machines to
exhibit Byzantine (i.e. random) behavior and thereby corrupt the accuracy and availability of
the replication protocol. In this paper, we propose a Kubernetes multi-Master Robust (KmMR) platform
to overcome this limitation. KmMR is based on the adaptation and integration of the BFT-SMaRt fault-tolerant
replication protocol into Kubernetes environment. Unlike Raft protocol, BFT-SMaRt is resistant
to both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Experimental results show that KmMR is able to guarantee
the continuity of services, even when the total number of tolerated faults is exceeded. In addition,
KmMR provides on average a consensus time 1000 times shorter than that achieved by the conventional
platform (with Raft), in such condition. Finally, we show that KmMR generates a small additional
cost in terms of resource consumption compared to the conventional platform.
