The standard technique used by commercial medical ultrasound systems to form B-mode images is delay
and sum (DAS) beamforming. However, DAS often results in limited image resolution and contrast,
which are governed by the center frequency and the aperture size of the ultrasound transducer. A
large number of elements leads to improved resolution but at the same time increases the data size
and the system cost due to the receive electronics required for each element. Therefore, reducing
the number of receiving channels while producing high quality images is of great importance. In
this paper, we introduce a nonlinear beamformer called COnvolutional Beamforming Algorithm (COBA),
which achieves a significant improvement of lateral resolution and contrast. In addition, it can
be implemented efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. Based on the COBA concept, we next
present two sparse beamformers with closed form expressions for the sensor locations, which result
in the same beam pattern as DAS and COBA while using far fewer array elements. Optimization of the
number of elements shows that they require a minimal number of elements which is on the order of the
square root of the number used by DAS. The performance of the proposed methods is tested and validated
using simulated data and in vivo cardiac data. Results prove that COBA outperforms DAS in terms of
resolution and contrast. In addition, they verify that the sparse beamformers offer a remarkable
element reduction while generating images with an equivalent or improved quality in comparison
to DAS.
