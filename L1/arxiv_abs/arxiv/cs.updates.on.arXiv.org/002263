The vehicle to represent Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) in the environment of the Semantic
Web and linked data is the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). SKOS provides a way to assign
a URI to each concept, and this URI functions as a surrogate for the concept. This fact makes of main
concern the need to clarify the URIs' ontological meaning. The aim of this study is to investigate
the relation between the ontological substance of KOS concepts and concepts revealed through the
grammatical and syntactic formalisms of natural language. For this purpose, we examined the dividableness
of concepts in specific KOSs (i.e. a thesaurus, a subject headings system and a classification scheme)
by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (i.e. morphosyntactic analysis) to
the lexical representations (i.e. RDF literals) of SKOS concepts. The results of the comparative
analysis reveal that, despite the use of multi-word units, thesauri tend to represent concepts
in a way that can hardly be further divided conceptually, while Subject Headings and Classification
Schemes - to a certain extent - comprise terms that can be decomposed into more conceptual constituents.
Consequently, SKOS concepts deriving from thesauri are more likely to represent atomic conceptual
units and thus be more appropriate tools for inference and reasoning. Since identifiers represent
the meaning of a concept, complex concepts are neither the most appropriate nor the most efficient
way of modelling a KOS for the Semantic Web.
