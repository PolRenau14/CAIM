As most users do not precisely know the structure and/or the content of databases, their queries
do not exactly reflect their information needs. The database management systems (DBMS) may interact
with users and use their feedback on the returned results to learn the information needs behind their
queries. Current query interfaces assume that users do not learn and modify the way way they express
their information needs in form of queries during their interaction with the DBMS. Using a real-world
interaction workload, we show that users learn and modify how to express their information needs
during their interactions with the DBMS and their learning is accurately modeled by a well-known
reinforcement learning mechanism. As current data interaction systems assume that users do not
modify their strategies, they cannot discover the information needs behind users' queries effectively.
We model the interaction between users and DBMS as a game with identical interest between two rational
agents whose goal is to establish a common language for representing information needs in form of
queries. We propose a reinforcement learning method that learns and answers the information needs
behind queries and adapts to the changes in users' strategies and prove that it improves the effectiveness
of answering queries stochastically speaking. We propose two efficient implementation of this
method over large relational databases. Our extensive empirical studies over real-world query
workloads indicate that our algorithms are efficient and effective.
