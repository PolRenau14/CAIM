Deep learning has been applied to various tasks in the field of machine learning and has shown superiority
to other common procedures such as kernel methods. To provide a better theoretical understanding
of the reasons for its success, we discuss the performance of deep learning and other methods on a
nonparametric regression problem with a Gaussian noise. Whereas existing theoretical studies
of deep learning have been based mainly on mathematical theories of well-known function classes
such as H\"{o}lder and Besov classes, we focus on function classes with discontinuity and sparsity,
which are those naturally assumed in practice. To highlight the effectiveness of deep learning,
we compare deep learning with a class of linear estimators representative of a class of shallow estimators.
It is shown that the minimax risk of a linear estimator on the convex hull of a target function class
does not differ from that of the original target function class. This results in the suboptimality
of linear methods over a simple but non-convex function class, on which deep learning can attain
nearly the minimax-optimal rate. In addition to this extreme case, we consider function classes
with sparse wavelet coefficients. On these function classes, deep learning also attains the minimax
rate up to log factors of the sample size, and linear methods are still suboptimal if the assumed sparsity
is strong. We also point out that the parameter sharing of deep neural networks can remarkably reduce
the complexity of the model in our setting.
