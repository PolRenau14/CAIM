We consider the problem of finding small distance-preserving subgraphs of undirected, unweighted
interval graphs with $k$ terminal vertices. To start with, we show that finding an optimal distance-preserving
subgraph is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for general graphs. Then, we show that every interval graph admits
a subgraph with $O(k)$ branching vertices that approximates pairwise terminal distances up to
an additive term of $+1$. We also present an interval graph $G_{\mathrm{int}}$ for which the $+1$
approximation is necessary to obtain the $O(k)$ upper bound on the number of branching vertices.
In particular, any distance-preserving subgraph of $G_{\mathrm{int}}$ has $\Omega(k\log k)$
branching vertices. Furthermore, we prove that every interval graph admits a distance-preserving
subgraph with $O(k\log k)$ branching vertices, implying that the $\Omega(k\log k)$ lower bound
for interval graphs is tight. To conclude, we show that there exists an interval graph such that every
optimal distance-preserving subgraph of it has $O(k)$ branching vertices and $\Omega(k\log k)$
branching edges, thereby providing a separation between branching vertices and branching edges.
The $O(k)$ bound for distance-approximating subgraphs follows from a na\"ive analysis of shortest
paths in interval graphs. $G_{\mathrm{int}}$ is constructed using bit-reversal permutation
matrices. The $O(k\log k)$ bound for distance-preserving subgraphs uses a divide-and-conquer
approach. Finally, the separation between branching vertices and branching edges employs Hansel's
lemma for graph covering.
