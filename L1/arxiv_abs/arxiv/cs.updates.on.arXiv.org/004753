Robots are increasingly entering uncertain and unstructured environments. Within these, robots
are bound to face unexpected external disturbances like accidental human or tool collisions. Robots
must develop the capacity to respond to unexpected events. That is not only identifying the sudden
anomaly, but also deciding how to handle it. In this work, we contribute a recovery policy that allows
a robot to recovery from various anomalous scenarios across different tasks and conditions in a
consistent and robust fashion. The system organizes tasks as a sequence of nodes composed of internal
modules such as motion generation and introspection. When an introspection module flags an anomaly,
the recovery strategy is triggered and reverts the task execution by selecting a target node as a
function of a state dependency chart. The new skill allows the robot to overcome the effects of the
external disturbance and conclude the task. Our system recovers from accidental human and tool
collisions in a number of tasks. Of particular importance is the fact that we test the robustness
of the recovery system by triggering anomalies at each node in the task graph showing robust recovery
everywhere in the task. We also trigger multiple and repeated anomalies at each of the nodes of the
task showing that the recovery system can consistently recover anywhere in the presence of strong
and pervasive anomalous conditions. Robust recovery systems will be key enablers for long-term
autonomy in robot systems. Supplemental info including code, data, graphs, and result analysis
