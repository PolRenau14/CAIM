In the wake of growth in intelligent mobile devices and wide usage of bandwidth-hungry applications
of mobile Internet, the demand of wireless data traffic and ubiquitous mobile broadband is rapidly
increasing. On account of these developments, the research on fifth generation (5G) networks presents
an accelerative tendency on a global scale. Edge computing draw lots of attention for reducing the
time delay and improving the Quality of Service for the networks. While, fog radio access networks
(F-RANs) is an emergent architecture, which takes full use of edge computing and distributed storing
capabilities in edge devices. In this article, we propose an architecture of non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) based F-RANs, which has a strong capability of edge computing and can meet the heterogeneous
requirements in 5G systems. NOMA with successive interference cancellation (SIC) is regarded
as a critical multi-user access technology. In NOMA, more than one user can access the same time,
code domain, and frequency resources. With assigning different power levels to multi-user and
implementing SIC, multiple users detection can be achieved. In this article, we provide a description
of the NOMA based F-RANs architecture, and discuss the resource allocation in that. We will focus
on the power and subchannel allocation in consideration of using NOMA and the edge caching. Simulation
results show that the proposed NOMA baesd F-RANs architecture and the resource management mechanisms
can achieve the high net utility for the RANs.
