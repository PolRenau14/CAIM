In the future, the United States government can seek to limit the ownership and usage of cyber weapons.
The question is whether the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution gives a right to bear
and own military-grade cyber weapons, and if so, under which conditions. The framers of the Bill
of Rights, ratified in 1791, did not limit the right to bear arms to defined weapons such as long rifles
and pistols, but instead chose the broader word arms. The United States Supreme Court, in the case
District of Columbia v. Heller, upheld a demarcation between dangerous and unusual weapons that
are not permissible to own and weapons protected by the Second Amendment. Cyber weapons take the
form of dual-use software, often shared and globally distributed that in most cases can be weaponized
for harmful purposes. In recent years, major corporations have sought to hack back, and if the hack
back is authorized, the question becomes whether corporations have digital gun rights. Even if
corporations are considered US persons, they do not automatically obtain digital gun rights based
on the Second Amendment. This article discusses the core constitutional challenges for the United
States government in prohibiting individual ownership of cyber weapons and the rationale for why
corporations are in a weaker position regarding ownership of cyber arms. The argument brought forward
is that individuals can claim Second Amendment protection of their right to own military-grade
software tools, but corporations must meet additional criteria to do so.
