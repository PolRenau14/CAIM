Scene parsing is an indispensable component in understanding the semantics within a scene. Traditional
methods rely on handcrafted local features and probabilistic graphical models to incorporate
local and global cues. Recently, methods based on fully convolutional neural networks have achieved
new records on scene parsing. An important strategy common to these methods is the aggregation of
hierarchical features yielded by a deep convolutional neural network. However, typical algorithms
usually aggregate hierarchical convolutional features via concatenation or linear combination,
which cannot sufficiently exploit the diversities of contextual information in multi-scale features
and the spatial inhomogeneity of a scene. In this paper, we propose a mixture-of-experts scene parsing
network (MoE-SPNet) that incorporates a convolutional mixture-of-experts layer to assess the
importance of features from different levels and at different spatial locations. In addition,
we propose a variant of mixture-of-experts called the adaptive hierarchical feature aggregation
(AHFA) mechanism which can be incorporated into existing scene parsing networks that use skip-connections
to fuse features layer-wisely. In the proposed networks, different levels of features at each spatial
location are adaptively re-weighted according to the local structure and surrounding contextual
information before aggregation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two
scene parsing datasets including PASCAL VOC 2012 and SceneParse150 based on two kinds of baseline
models FCN-8s and DeepLab-ASPP.
