Today, there is a trend to incorporate more intelligence (e.g., vision capabilities) into a wide
range of devices, which makes high performance a necessity for computing systems. Furthermore,
for embedded systems, low power consumption should be generally considered together with high
computing performance. FPGAs, as programmable logic devices able to support different types of
fine-grained parallelisms, their power and performance advantages were recognized widely. However,
designing applications on FPGA-based systems is traditionally far from a task can be carried out
by software programmers. Generally, hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers
have more hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application knowledge. Thus,
it is critical for computing systems to allow application-level programmers to realize their idea
conveniently, which is popular in computing systems based on the general processor. In this paper,
the OpenHEC (Open Framework for High-Efficiency Computing) framework is proposed to provide a
design framework for application-level software programmers to use FPGA-based platforms. It
frees users from hardware and architectural details to let them focus more on algorithms/applications.
This framework was integrated with the commercial Xilinx ISE/Vivado to make it to be used immediately.
After implementing a widely-used feature detection algorithm on OpenHEC from the perspective
of software programmers, it shows this framework is applicable for application programmers with
little hardware knowledge.
