In this paper, we focus on a typical cooperative communication system with one pair of source and
destination, where a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying from a start location to an end location
serves as a mobile relay. To efficiently utilize energy in ambient environment, the UAV's transmission
capability is powered exclusively by radio signal transmitted from the source via the power-splitting
mechanism. In such a cooperative communication system, we study the end-to-end cooperative throughput
maximization problem by optimizing the UAV's power profile, power-splitting ratio profile and
trajectory for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols. The problem
is decomposed into two subproblems: profile optimization given trajectory and trajectory optimization
given profile. The former one is solved via the dual decomposition with in-depth analysis and the
latter one is solved via successive convex optimization, by which a lower bound is iteratively maximized.
Then the end-to-end cooperative throughput maximization problem is solved by alternately solving
the two subproblems. The numerical results show that with the proposed optimal solution, choice
for the UAV's power profile and power-splitting ratio profile is more long-sighted than the greedy
strategy from our previous work and the successive optimization is able to converge in a few rounds
of iteration. Moreover, as for the end-to-end cooperative throughput, the proposed optimal solution
outperforms both static and greedy strategies, especially for the AF protocol.
