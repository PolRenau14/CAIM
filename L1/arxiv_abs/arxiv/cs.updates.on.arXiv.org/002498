Spreadsheet software is the tool of choice for interactive ad-hoc data management, with adoption
by billions of users. However, spreadsheets are not scalable, unlike database systems. On the other
hand, database systems, while highly scalable, do not support interactivity as a first-class primitive.
We are developing DataSpread, to holistically integrate spreadsheets as a front-end interface
with databases as a back-end datastore, providing scalability to spreadsheets, and interactivity
to databases, an integration we term presentational data management (PDM). In this paper, we make
a first step towards this vision: developing a storage engine for PDM, studying how to flexibly represent
spreadsheet data within a database and how to support and maintain access by position. We first conduct
an extensive survey of spreadsheet use to motivate our functional requirements for a storage engine
for PDM. We develop a natural set of mechanisms for flexibly representing spreadsheet data and demonstrate
that identifying the optimal representation is NP-Hard; however, we develop an efficient approach
to identify the optimal representation from an important and intuitive subclass of representations.
We extend our mechanisms with positional access mechanisms that don't suffer from cascading update
issues, leading to constant time access and modification performance. We evaluate these representations
on a workload of typical spreadsheets and spreadsheet operations, providing up to 20% reduction
in storage, and up to 50% reduction in formula evaluation time.
