Often fairness assumptions need to be made in order to establish liveness properties of distributed
systems, but in many situations these lead to false conclusions. This document presents a research
agenda aiming at laying the foundations of a theory of concurrency that is equipped to ensure liveness
properties of distributed systems without making fairness assumptions. This theory will encompass
process algebra, temporal logic and semantic models, as well as treatments of real-time. The agenda
also includes developing a methodology that allows successful application of this theory to the
specification, analysis and verification of realistic distributed systems, including routing
protocols for wireless networks. Contemporary process algebras and temporal logics fail to make
distinctions between systems of which one has a crucial liveness property and the other does not,
at least when assuming justness, a strong progress property, but not assuming fairness. Setting
up an alternative framework involves giving up on identifying strongly bisimilar systems, inventing
new induction principles, developing new axiomatic bases for process algebras and new congruence
formats for operational semantics, and creating new treatments of time and probability. Even simple
systems like fair schedulers or mutual exclusion protocols cannot be accurately specified in standard
process algebras (or Petri nets) in the absence of fairness assumptions. Hence the work involves
the study of adequate language or model extensions, and their expressive power.
