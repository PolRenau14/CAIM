The rising interest in the construction and the quality of (business) process models resulted in
an abundancy of emerged research studies and different findings about process model quality. The
lack of overview and the lack of consensus hinder the development of the research field. The research
objective is to collect, analyse, structure, and integrate the existing knowledge in a comprehensive
framework that strives to find a balance between completeness and relevance without hindering
the overview. The Systematic Literature Review methodology was applied to collect the relevant
studies. Because several studies exist that each partially addresses this research objective,
the review was performed at a tertiary level. Based on a critical analysis of the collected papers,
a comprehensive, but structured overview of the state of the art in the field was composed. The existing
academic knowledge about process model quality was carefully integrated and structured into the
Comprehensive Process Model Quality Framework (CPMQF). The framework summarizes 39 quality dimensions,
21 quality metrics, 28 quality (sub)drivers, 44 (sub)driver metrics, 64 realization initiatives
and 15 concrete process model purposes related to 4 types of organizational benefits, as well as
the relations between all of these. This overview is thus considered to form a valuable instrument
for both researchers and practitioners that are concerned about process model quality. The framework
is the first to address the concept of process model quality in such a comprehensive way.
