Multiview video supports observing a scene from different viewpoints. The Joint Video Team (JVT)
developed H.264/MVC to enhance the compression efficiency for multiview video, however, MVC encoded
multiview video (MVC video) still requires the high bitrates for transmission. This paper investigates
live MVC video streaming over Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The goal is to minimize the server bandwidth
costs whist ensuring high streaming quality to peers. MVC employs intra-view and inter-view prediction
structures, which leads to a complicated layer dependency relationship. As the peers' outbound
bandwidth is shared while supplying all the MVC video layers, the bandwidth allocation to one MVC
layer affects the available outbound bandwidth of the other layers. To optimise the utilisation
of the peers' outbound bandwidth for providing video layers, a maximum flow based model is proposed
which considers the MVC video layer dependency and the layer supplying relationship between peers.
Based on the model, a layer dependency aware live MVC video streaming method over a BitTorrent-like
P2P network is proposed, named MVP2P. The key components of MVP2P include a chunk scheduling strategy
and a peer selection strategy for receiving peers, and a bandwidth scheduling algorithm for supplying
peers. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, MVP2P is compared with existing methods
considering the constraints of peer bandwidth, peer numbers, view switching rates, and peer churns.
The test results show that MVP2P significantly outperforms the existing methods.
