The well-known DeMillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel lemma says that $n$-variate polynomials of total
degree at most $d$ over grids, i.e. sets of the form $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n$, form
error-correcting codes (of distance at least $2^{-d}$ provided $\min_i\{|A_i|\}\geq 2$). In
this work we explore their local decodability and (tolerant) local testability. While these aspects
have been studied extensively when $A_1 = \cdots = A_n = \mathbb{F}_q$ are the same finite field,
the setting when $A_i$'s are not the full field does not seem to have been explored before. In this
work we focus on the case $A_i = \{0,1\}$ for every $i$. We show that for every field (finite or otherwise)
there is a test whose query complexity depends only on the degree (and not on the number of variables).
In contrast we show that decodability is possible over fields of positive characteristic (with
query complexity growing with the degree of the polynomial and the characteristic), but not over
the reals, where the query complexity must grow with $n$. As a consequence we get a natural example
of a code (one with a transitive group of symmetries) that is locally testable but not locally decodable.
Classical results on local decoding and testing of polynomials have relied on the 2-transitive
symmetries of the space of low-degree polynomials (under affine transformations). Grids do not
possess this symmetry: So we introduce some new techniques to overcome this handicap and in particular
use the hypercontractivity of the (constant weight) noise operator on the Hamming cube.
