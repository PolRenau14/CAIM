Holoscopic 3D imaging is a promising technique for capturing full colour spatial 3D images using
a single aperture holoscopic 3D camera. It mimics fly's eye technique with a microlens array, which
views the scene at a slightly different angle to its adjacent lens that records three dimensional
information onto a two dimensional surface. This paper proposes a method of depth map generation
from a holoscopic 3D image based on graph cut technique. The principal objective of this study is
to estimate the depth information presented in a holoscopic 3D image with high precision. As such,
depth map extraction is measured from a single still holoscopic 3D image which consists of multiple
viewpoint images. The viewpoints are extracted and utilised for disparity calculation via disparity
space image technique and pixels displacement is measured with sub pixel accuracy to overcome the
issue of the narrow baseline between the viewpoint images for stereo matching. In addition, cost
aggregation is used to correlate the matching costs within a particular neighbouring region using
sum of absolute difference SAD combined with gradient-based metric and winner takes all algorithm
is employed to select the minimum elements in the array as optimal disparity value. Finally, the
optimal depth map is obtained using graph cut technique. The proposed method extends the utilisation
of holoscopic 3D imaging system and enables the expansion of the technology for various applications
of autonomous robotics, medical, inspection, AR VR, security and entertainment where 3D depth
sensing and measurement are a concern.
