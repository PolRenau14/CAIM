In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal scalable video delivery to mobile users in wireless
networks given arbitrary Quality Adaptation (QA) mechanisms. In current practical systems, QA
and scheduling are performed independently by the content provider and network operator, respectively.
While most research has been focused on jointly optimizing these two tasks, the high complexity
that comes with a joint approach makes the implementation impractical. Therefore, we present a
scheduling mechanism that takes the QA logic of each user as input and optimizes the scheduling accordingly.
Hence, there is no need for centralized QA and cross-layer interactions are minimized. We model
the QA-adaptive scheduling and the jointly optimal problem as a Restless Bandit and a Multi-user
Semi Markov Decision Process, respectively in order to compare the loss incurred by not employing
a jointly optimal scheme. We then present heuristic algorithms in order to achieve the optimal outcome
of the Restless Bandit solution assuming the base station has knowledge of the underlying quality
adaptation of each user (QA-Aware). We also present a simplified heuristic without the need for
any higher layer knowledge at the base station (QA-Blind). We show that our QA-Aware strategy can
achieve up to two times improvement in user network utilization compared to popular baseline algorithms
such as Proportional Fairness. We also provide a testbed implementation of the QA-Blind scheme
in order to compare it with baseline algorithms in a real network setting.
