This article proposes an edge content delivery framework (ECD) based on mobile edge computing in
the era of Internet of Things (IOT), to alleviate the load of the core network and improve the quality
of experience (QoE) of mobile users. Considering mobile devices become both the content consumers
and providers, and majority of the contents are unnecessary to be uploaded to the cloud datacenter,
at the network edge, we deploy a content server to store the raw contents generated from the mobile
users, and a cache pool to store the contents that are frequently requested by mobile users in the
ECD. The cache pools are ranked and high ranked cache pools will store contents with higher popularity.
Furthermore, we propose edge content delivery scheme and edge content update scheme, based on content
popularity and cache pool ranking. The content delivery scheme is to efficiently deliver contents
to mobile users, while the edge content update scheme is to mitigate the content generated by users
to appropriate cache pools based on its request frequently and cache poor ranking. The edge content
delivery is completely different from the content delivery network and can further reduce the load
on the core network. In addition, because the top ranking cache pools are prioritized for higher
priority contents and the cache pools are prioritized for higher priority contents and the cache
pools are in proximity to the mobile users, the immediately interactive response between mobile
users and cache pools can be achieved. A representative case study of ECD is provided and open research
issues are discussed.
