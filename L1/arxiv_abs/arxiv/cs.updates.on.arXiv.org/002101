Human pose-estimation in a multi-person image involves detection of various body parts and grouping
them into individual person clusters. While the former task is challenging due to mutual occlusions,
the combinatorial complexity of the latter task is very high. We propose a greedy part assignment
algorithm that exploits the inherent structure of the human body to achieve a lower complexity,
compared to any of the prior published works. This is accomplished by (i) reducing the number of part-candidates
using the estimated number of people in the image, (ii) doing a greedy sequential assignment of part-classes,
following the kinematic chain from head to ankle (iii) doing a greedy assignment of parts in each
part-class set, to person-clusters (iv) limiting the candidate person clusters to the most proximal
clusters using human anthropometric data and (v) using only a specific subset of pre-assigned parts
for establishing pairwise structural constraints. We show that, these steps result in a sparse
body parts relationship graph and reduces the complexity. We also propose methods for improving
the accuracy of pose-estimation by (i) spawning person-clusters from any unassigned significant
body part and (ii) suppressing hallucinated parts. On the MPII multi-person pose database, pose-estimation
using the proposed method takes only 0.14 seconds per image. We show that, our proposed algorithm,
by using a large spatial and structural context, achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on both
MPII and WAF multi-person pose datasets, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.
