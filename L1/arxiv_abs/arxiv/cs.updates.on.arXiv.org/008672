We formulate the abnormal event detection problem as an outlier detection task and we propose a two-stage
algorithm based on k-means clustering and one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) to eliminate
outliers. In the feature extraction stage, we propose to augment spatio-temporal cubes with deep
appearance features extracted from the last convolutional layer of a pre-trained neural network.
After extracting motion and appearance features from the training video containing only normal
events, we apply k-means clustering to find clusters representing different types of normal motion
and appearance features. In the first stage, we consider that clusters with fewer samples (with
respect to a given threshold) contain mostly outliers, and we eliminate these clusters altogether.
In the second stage, we shrink the borders of the remaining clusters by training a one-class SVM model
on each cluster. To detected abnormal events in the test video, we analyze each test sample and consider
its maximum normality score provided by the trained one-class SVM models, based on the intuition
that a test sample can belong to only one cluster of normality. If the test sample does not fit well
in any narrowed normality cluster, then it is labeled as abnormal. We compare our method with several
state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark data sets. The empirical results indicate that our
abnormal event detection framework can achieve better results in most cases, while processing
the test video in real-time at 24 frames per second on a single CPU.
