Regional language extraction from a natural scene image is always a challenging proposition due
to its dependence on the text information extracted from Image. Text Extraction on the other hand
varies on different lighting condition, arbitrary orientation, inadequate text information,
heavy background influence over text and change of text appearance. This paper presents a novel
unified method for tackling the above challenges. The proposed work uses an image correction and
segmentation technique on the existing Text Detection Pipeline an Efficient and Accurate Scene
Text Detector (EAST). EAST uses standard PVAnet architecture to select features and non maximal
suppression to detect text from image. Text recognition is done using combined architecture of
MaxOut convolution neural network (CNN) and Bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) network.
After recognizing text using the Deep Learning based approach, the native Languages are translated
to English and tokenized using standard Text Tokenizers. The tokens that very likely represent
a location is used to find the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the location and subsequently
the regional languages spoken in that location is extracted. The proposed method is tested on a self
generated dataset collected from Government of India dataset and experimented on Standard Dataset
to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. Comparative study with a few state-of-the-art
methods on text detection, recognition and extraction of regional language from images shows that
the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.
