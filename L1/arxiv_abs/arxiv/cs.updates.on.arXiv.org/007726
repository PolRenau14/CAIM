Research in transaction processing has made significant progress in improving the performance
of multi-core in-memory transactional systems. However, the focus has mainly been on low-contention
workloads. Modern transactional systems perform poorly on workloads with transactions accessing
a few highly contended data items. We observe that most transactional workloads, including those
with high contention, can be divided into clusters of data conflict-free transactions and a small
set of residuals. In this paper, we introduce a new concurrency control protocol called Strife that
leverages the above observation. Strife executes transactions in batches, where each batch is
partitioned into clusters of conflict-free transactions and a small set of residual transactions.
The conflict-free clusters are executed in parallel without any concurrency control, followed
by executing the residual cluster either serially or with concurrency control. We present a low-overhead
algorithm that partitions a batch of transactions into clusters that do not have cross-cluster
conflicts and a small residual cluster. We evaluate Strife against the optimistic concurrency
control protocol and several variants of two-phase locking, where the latter is known to perform
better than other concurrency protocols under high contention, and show that Strife can improve
transactional throughput by up to 2x. We also perform an in-depth micro-benchmark analysis to empirically
characterize the performance and quality of our clustering algorithm
