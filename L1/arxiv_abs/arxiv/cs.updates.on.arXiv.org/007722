Fairness is an increasingly important concern as machine learning models are used to support decision
making in high-stakes applications such as mortgage lending, hiring, and prison sentencing. This
paper introduces a new open source Python toolkit for algorithmic fairness, AI Fairness 360 (AIF360),
released under an Apache v2.0 license {https://github.com/ibm/aif360). The main objectives
of this toolkit are to help facilitate the transition of fairness research algorithms to use in an
industrial setting and to provide a common framework for fairness researchers to share and evaluate
algorithms. The package includes a comprehensive set of fairness metrics for datasets and models,
explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models. It also
includes an interactive Web experience (https://aif360.mybluemix.net) that provides a gentle
introduction to the concepts and capabilities for line-of-business users, as well as extensive
documentation, usage guidance, and industry-specific tutorials to enable data scientists and
practitioners to incorporate the most appropriate tool for their problem into their work products.
The architecture of the package has been engineered to conform to a standard paradigm used in data
science, thereby further improving usability for practitioners. Such architectural design and
abstractions enable researchers and developers to extend the toolkit with their new algorithms
and improvements, and to use it for performance benchmarking. A built-in testing infrastructure
maintains code quality.
