Unconstrained face recognition performance evaluations have traditionally focused on Labeled
Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset for imagery and the YouTubeFaces (YTF) dataset for videos in the last
couple of years. Spectacular progress in this field has resulted in saturation on verification
and identification accuracies for those benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose a unified
learning framework named Transferred Deep Feature Fusion (TDFF) targeting at the new IARPA Janus
Benchmark A (IJB-A) face recognition dataset released by NIST face challenge. The IJB-A dataset
includes real-world unconstrained faces from 500 subjects with full pose and illumination variations
which are much harder than the LFW and YTF datasets. Inspired by transfer learning, we train two advanced
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with two different large datasets in source domain,
respectively. By exploring the complementarity of two distinct DCNNs, deep feature fusion is utilized
after feature extraction in target domain. Then, template specific linear SVMs is adopted to enhance
the discrimination of framework. Finally, multiple matching scores corresponding different
templates are merged as the final results. This simple unified framework exhibits excellent performance
on IJB-A dataset. Based on the proposed approach, we have submitted our IJB-A results to National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for official evaluation. Moreover, by introducing
new data and advanced neural architecture, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a wide
margin on IJB-A dataset.
