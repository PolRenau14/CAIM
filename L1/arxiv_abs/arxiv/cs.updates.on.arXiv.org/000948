The objective of this research work is to improve the degree of excellence by removing the number
of exceptions from the software. The modern age is more concerned with the quality of software. Extensive
research is being carried out in this direction. The rate of improvement of quality of software largely
depends on the development time. This development time is chiefly calculated in clock hours. However
development time does not reflect the effort put in by the developer. A better parameter can be the
rate of improvement of quality level or the rate of improvement of the degree of excellence with respect
to time. Now this parameter needs the prediction of error level and degree of excellence at a particular
stage of development of the software. This paper explores an attempt to develop a system to predict
rate of improvement of the software quality at a particular point of time with respect to the number
of lines of code present in the software. Having calculated the error level and degree of excellence
at two points in time, we can move forward towards the estimation of the rate of improvement of the
software quality with respect to time. This parameter can estimate the effort put in while development
of the software and can add a new dimension to the understanding of software quality in software engineering
domain. In order to obtain the results we have used an indigenous tool for software quality prediction
and for graphical representation of data, we have used Microsoft office 2007 graphical chart.
