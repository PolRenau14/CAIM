With advances in sequencing technologies, there are now massive amounts of genomic data from across
all life, leading to the possibility that a robust Tree of Life can be constructed. However, "gene
tree heterogeneity", which is when different genomic regions can evolve differently, is a common
phenomenon in multi-locus datasets, and reduces the accuracy of standard methods for species tree
estimation that do not take this heterogeneity into account. New methods have been developed for
species tree estimation that specifically address gene tree heterogeneity, and that have been
proven to converge to the true species tree when the number of loci and number of sites per locus both
increase (i.e., the methods are said to be "statistically consistent"). Yet, little is known about
the biologically realistic condition where the number of sites per locus is bounded. We show that
when the sequence length of each locus is bounded (by any arbitrarily chosen value), the most common
approaches to species tree estimation that take heterogeneity into account (i.e., traditional
fully partitioned concatenated maximum likelihood and newer approaches, called summary methods,
that estimate the species tree by combining gene trees) are not statistically consistent, even
when the heterogeneity is extremely constrained. The main challenge is the presence of conditions
such as long branch attraction that create biased tree estimation when the number of sites is restricted.
Hence, our study uncovers a fundamental challenge to species tree estimation using both traditional
and new methods.
