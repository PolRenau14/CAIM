Two-dimensional embeddings remain the dominant approach to visualize high dimensional data.
The choice of embeddings ranges from highly non-linear ones, which can capture complex relationships
but are difficult to interpret quantitatively, to axis-aligned projections, which are easy to
interpret but are limited to bivariate relationships. Linear project can be considered as a compromise
between complexity and interpretability, as they allow explicit axes labels, yet provide significantly
more degrees of freedom compared to axis-aligned projections. Nevertheless, interpreting the
axes directions, which are linear combinations often with many non-trivial components, remains
difficult. To address this problem we introduce a structure aware decomposition of (multiple)
linear projections into sparse sets of axis aligned projections, which jointly capture all information
of the original linear ones. In particular, we use tools from Dempster-Shafer theory to formally
define how relevant a given axis aligned project is to explain the neighborhood relations displayed
in some linear projection. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to discover a diverse set of
high quality linear projections and show that in practice the information of $k$ linear projections
is often jointly encoded in $\sim k$ axis aligned plots. We have integrated these ideas into an interactive
visualization system that allows users to jointly browse both linear projections and their axis
aligned representatives. Using a number of case studies we show how the resulting plots lead to more
intuitive visualizations and new insight.
