Any non-trivial concurrent system warrants synchronisation, regardless of the concurrency model.
Actor-based concurrency serialises all computations in an actor through asynchronous message
passing. In contrast, lock-based concurrency serialises some computations by following a lock--unlock
protocol for accessing certain data. Both systems require sound reasoning about pointers and aliasing
to exclude data-races. If actor isolation is broken, so is the single-thread-of-control abstraction.
Similarly for locks, if a datum is accessible outside of the scope of the lock, the datum is not governed
by the lock. In this paper we discuss how to balance aliasing and synchronisation. In previous work,
we defined a type system that guarantees data-race freedom of actor-based concurrency and lock-based
concurrency. This paper extends this work by the introduction of two programming constructs; one
for decoupling isolation and synchronisation and one for constructing higher-level atomicity
guarantees from lower-level synchronisation. We focus predominantly on actors, and in particular
the Encore programming language, but our ultimate goal is to define our constructs in such a way that
they can be used both with locks and actors, given that combinations of both models occur frequently
in actual systems. We discuss the design space, provide several formalisations of different semantics
and discuss their properties, and connect them to case studies showing how our proposed constructs
can be useful. We also report on an on-going implementation of our proposed constructs in Encore.
