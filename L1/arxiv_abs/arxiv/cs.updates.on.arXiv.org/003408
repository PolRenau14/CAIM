Convolutional Neural Networks has been implemented in many complex machine learning takes such
as image classification, object identification, autonomous vehicle and robotic vision tasks.
However, ConvNet architecture efficiency and accuracy depend on a large number of fac- tors. Also,
the complex architecture requires a significant amount of data to train and involves with a large
number of hyperparameters that increases the computational expenses and difficul- ties. Hence,
it is necessary to address the limitations and techniques to overcome the barriers to ensure that
the architecture performs well in complex visual tasks. This article is intended to develop an efficient
ConvNet architecture for multi-class image categorical classification applica- tion. In the
development of the architecture, large pool of grey scale images are taken as input information
images and split into training and test datasets. The numerously available technique is implemented
to reduce the overfitting and poor generalization of the network. The hyperpa- rameters of determined
by Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process prior algorithm. ReLu non-linear activation function
is implemented after the convolutional layers. Max pooling op- eration is carried out to downsampling
the data points in pooling layers. Cross-entropy loss function is used to measure the performance
of the architecture where the softmax is used in the classification layer. Mini-batch gradient
descent with Adam optimizer algorithm is used for backpropagation. Developed architecture is
validated with confusion matrix and classification report.
