Incremental Learning is well known machine learning approach wherein the weights of the learned
model are dynamically and gradually updated to generalize on new unseen data without forgetting
the existing knowledge. Incremental learning proves to be time as well as resource-efficient solution
for deployment of deep learning algorithms in real world as the model can automatically and dynamically
adapt to new data as and when annotated data becomes available. The development and deployment of
Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools in medical domain is another scenario, where incremental
learning becomes very crucial as collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset spanning
over multiple pathologies and imaging machines might take years. However, not much has so far been
explored in this direction. In the current work, we propose a robust and efficient method for incremental
learning in medical imaging domain. Our approach makes use of Hard Example Mining technique (which
is commonly used as a solution to heavy class imbalance) to automatically select a subset of dataset
to fine-tune the existing network weights such that it adapts to new data while retaining existing
knowledge. We develop our approach for incremental learning of our already under test model for
detecting dental caries. Further, we apply our approach to one publicly available dataset and demonstrate
that our approach reaches the accuracy of training on entire dataset at once, while availing the
benefits of incremental learning scenario.
