Community detection emerges as an important task in the discovery of network mesoscopic structures.
However, the concept of a "good" community is very context-dependent and it is relatively complicated
to deduce community characteristics using available community detection techniques. In reality,
the existence of a gap between structural goodness quality metrics and expected topological patterns
creates a confusion in evaluating community structures. In this paper, we introduce an empirical
multivariate analysis of different structural goodness properties in order to characterize several
detectable community topologies. Specifically, we show that a combination of two representative
structural dimensions including community transitivity and hub dominance allows to distinguish
different topologies such as star-based, clique-based, string-based and grid-based structures.
Additionally, these classes of topology disclose structural proximities with those of graphs
created by Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'{a}si-Albert generative models.
We illustrate popular community topologies identified by different detection methods on a large
dataset composing many network categories and associate their structures with the most related
graph generative model. Interestingly, this conjunctive representation sheds light on fundamental
differences between mesoscopic structures in various network categories including: communication,
information, biological, technological, social, ecological, synthetic networks and more.
