Compressive sensing (CS) has proved effective for tomographic reconstruction from sparsely collected
data or under-sampled measurements, which are practically important for few-view CT, tomosynthesis,
interior tomography, and so on. To perform sparse-data CT, the iterative reconstruction commonly
use regularizers in the CS framework. Currently, how to choose the parameters adaptively for regularization
is a major open problem. In this paper, inspired by the idea of machine learning especially deep learning,
we unfold a state-of-the-art "fields of experts" based iterative reconstruction scheme up to a
number of iterations for data-driven training, construct a Learned Experts' Assessment-based
Reconstruction Network ("LEARN") for sparse-data CT, and demonstrate the feasibility and merits
of our LEARN network. The experimental results with our proposed LEARN network produces a competitive
performance with the well-known Mayo Clinic Low-Dose Challenge Dataset relative to several state-of-the-art
methods, in terms of artifact reduction, feature preservation, and computational speed. This
is consistent to our insight that because all the regularization terms and parameters used in the
iterative reconstruction are now learned from the training data, our LEARN network utilizes application-oriented
knowledge more effectively and recovers underlying images more favorably than competing algorithms.
Also, the number of layers in the LEARN network is only 12, reducing the computational complexity
of typical iterative algorithms by orders of magnitude.
