Valiant's famous determinant versus permanent problem is the flagship problem in algebraic complexity
theory. Mulmuley and Sohoni (Siam J Comput 2001, 2008) introduced geometric complexity theory,
an approach to study this and related problems via algebraic geometry and representation theory.
Their approach works by multiplying the permanent polynomial with a high power of a linear form (a
process called padding) and then comparing the orbit closures of the determinant and the padded
permanent. This padding was recently used heavily to show no-go results for the method of shifted
partial derivatives (Efremenko, Landsberg, Schenck, Weyman, 2016) and for geometric complexity
theory (Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016 and B\"urgisser, Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016). Following
a classical homogenization result of Nisan (STOC 1991) we replace the determinant in geometric
complexity theory with the trace of a variable matrix power. This gives an equivalent but much cleaner
homogeneous formulation of geometric complexity theory in which the padding is removed. This radically
changes the representation theoretic questions involved to prove complexity lower bounds. We
prove that in this homogeneous formulation there are no orbit occurrence obstructions that prove
even superlinear lower bounds on the complexity of the permanent. This is the first no-go result
in geometric complexity theory that rules out superlinear lower bounds in some model. Interestingly---in
contrast to the determinant---the trace of a variable matrix power is not uniquely determined by
its stabilizer.
