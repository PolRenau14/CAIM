We present crowdsourcing as an additional modality to aid radiologists in the diagnosis of lung
cancer from clinical chest computed tomography (CT) scans. More specifically, a complete workflow
is introduced which can help maximize the sensitivity of lung nodule detection by utilizing the
collective intelligence of the crowd. We combine the concept of overlapping thin-slab maximum
intensity projections (TS-MIPs) and cine viewing to render short videos that can be outsourced
as an annotation task to the crowd. These videos are generated by linearly interpolating overlapping
TS-MIPs of CT slices through the depth of each quadrant of a patient's lung. The resultant videos
are outsourced to an online community of non-expert users who, after a brief tutorial, annotate
suspected nodules in these video segments. Using our crowdsourcing workflow, we achieved a lung
nodule detection sensitivity of over 90% for 20 patient CT datasets (containing 178 lung nodules
with sizes between 1-30mm), and only 47 false positives from a total of 1021 annotations on nodules
of all sizes (96% sensitivity for nodules$>$4mm). These results show that crowdsourcing can be
a robust and scalable modality to aid radiologists in screening for lung cancer, directly or in combination
with computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms. For CAD algorithms, the presented workflow can
provide highly accurate training data to overcome the high false-positive rate (per scan) problem.
We also provide, for the first time, analysis on nodule size and position which can help improve CAD
algorithms.
