We show that the counting class LWPP [FFK94] remains unchanged even if one allows a polynomial number
of gap values rather than one. On the other hand, we show that it is impossible to improve this from
polynomially many gap values to a superpolynomial number of gap values by relativizable proof techniques.
The first of these results implies that the Legitimate Deck Problem (from the study of graph reconstruction)
is in LWPP (and thus low for PP, i.e., $\rm PP^{\mbox{Legitimate Deck}} = PP$) if the weakened version
of the Reconstruction Conjecture holds in which the number of nonisomorphic preimages is assumed
merely to be polynomially bounded. This strengthens the 1992 result of K\"{o}bler, Sch\"{o}ning,
and Tor\'{a}n [KST92] that the Legitimate Deck Problem is in LWPP if the Reconstruction Conjecture
holds, and provides strengthened evidence that the Legitimate Deck Problem is not NP-hard. We additionally
show on the one hand that our main LWPP robustness result also holds for WPP, and also holds even when
one allows both the rejection- and acceptance- gap-value targets to simultaneously be polynomial-sized
lists; yet on the other hand, we show that for the #P-based analog of LWPP the behavior much differs
in that, in some relativized worlds, even two target values already yield a richer class than one
value does. Despite that nonrobustness result for a #P-based class, we show that the #P-based "exact
counting" class $\rm C_{=}P$ remains unchanged even if one allows a polynomial number of target
values for the number of accepting paths of the machine.
