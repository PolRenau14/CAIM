As universities recognize the inherent value in the data they collect and hold, they encounter unforeseen
challenges in stewarding those data in ways that balance accountability, transparency, and protection
of privacy, academic freedom, and intellectual property. Two parallel developments in academic
data collection are converging: (1) open access requirements, whereby researchers must provide
access to their data as a condition of obtaining grant funding or publishing results in journals;
and (2) the vast accumulation of 'grey data' about individuals in their daily activities of research,
teaching, learning, services, and administration. The boundaries between research and grey data
are blurring, making it more difficult to assess the risks and responsibilities associated with
any data collection. Many sets of data, both research and grey, fall outside privacy regulations
such as HIPAA, FERPA, and PII. Universities are exploiting these data for research, learning analytics,
faculty evaluation, strategic decisions, and other sensitive matters. Commercial entities are
besieging universities with requests for access to data or for partnerships to mine them. The privacy
frontier facing research universities spans open access practices, uses and misuses of data, public
records requests, cyber risk, and curating data for privacy protection. This paper explores the
competing values inherent in data stewardship and makes recommendations for practice, drawing
on the pioneering work of the University of California in privacy and information security, data
governance, and cyber risk.
