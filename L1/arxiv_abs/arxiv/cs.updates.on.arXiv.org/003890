Order-preserving encryption allows encrypting data, while still enabling efficient range queries
on the encrypted data. Moreover, it does not require any change to the database management system,
because comparison operates on ciphertexts as on plaintexts. This makes order-preserving encryption
schemes very suitable for data outsourcing in cloud computing scenarios. However, all order-preserving
encryption schemes are necessarily symmetric limiting the use case to one client and one server.
Imagine a scenario where a Data Owner encrypts its data before outsourcing it to the Cloud Service
Provider and a Data Analyst wants to execute private range queries on this data. This scenario occurs
in many cases of collaborative machine learning where data source and processor are different entities.
Then either the Data Owner must reveal its encryption key or the Data Analyst must reveal the private
queries. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by allowing the equivalent of a public-key order-preserving
encryption. We present a secure multiparty protocol that enables secure range queries for multiple
users. In this scheme, the Data Analyst cooperates with the Data Owner and the Cloud Service Provider
in order to order-preserving encrypt the private range queries without revealing any other information
to the parties. We implemented our scheme and observed that if the database size of the Data Owner
has 1 million entries it takes only about 0.3 s on average via a loopback interface (1.3 s via a LAN)
to encrypt an input of the Data Analyst.
