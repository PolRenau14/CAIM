Cooperative device to device (CD2D) communication has been considered to be a solution to capacity
shortage problem. Combining multi-homing and CD2D techniques together can potentially improve
network performance. We propose a novel multi-homing CD2D (MH-CD2D) network, in which multiple
homing mobile devices (MMDs) act as relays for the cooperative communications of ordinary mobile
devices (OMDs). We formulate such joint bandwidth-relay allocation problem as a two-stage game,
in order to deal with two challenges: how to motivate MMDs to lease spare bandwidths and help OMDs
to choose appropriate MMD relays. In the first stage, we use a non-cooperative game to model the competition
between MMDs in terms of shared bandwidth and price. In the second stage, we model the behavior of
OMDs selecting MMDs by an evolutionary game. We prove that there exists Nash equilibrium in the game
and propose a distributed incentive scheme named IMES to solve the joint bandwidth-relay allocation
problem. Extensive simulation results show that the equilibrium can be achieved and the best response
price of one MMD increases with the other's best price in the Stackelberg game. The utility of MMDs
increases with the number of OMDs in each OMD group at the evolutionary equilibrium. The proposed
algorithms are able to reduce average service delay by more than 25% in comparison to the randomized
scheme which is frequently used in existing works. On average, IMES outperforms existing scheme
by about 20.37% in terms of utility of MMDs.
