Static verification techniques leverage Boolean formula satisfiability solvers such as SAT and
SMT solvers that operate on conjunctive normal form and first order logic formulae, respectively,
to validate programs. They force bounds on variable ranges and execution time and translate the
program and its specifications into a Boolean formula. They are limited to programs of relatively
low complexity for the following reasons. (1) A small increase in the bounds can cause a large increase
in the size of the translated formula. (2) Boolean satisfiability solvers are restricted to using
optimizations that apply at the level of the formula. Finally, (3) the Boolean formulae often need
to be regenerated with higher bounds to ensure the correctness of the translation. We present a method
that uses sequential circuits, Boolean formulae with memory elements and hierarchical structure,
and sequential circuit synthesis and verification frameworks to validate programs. (1) Sequential
circuits are much more succinct than Boolean formulae with no memory elements and preserve the high-level
structure of the program. (2) Encoding the problem as a sequential circuit enables the use of a number
of powerful automated analysis techniques that have no counterparts for other Boolean formulae.
Our method takes an imperative program with a first order logic specification consisting of a precondition
and a postcondition pair, and a bound on the program variable ranges, and produces a sequential circuit
with a designated output that is true when the program violates the specification.
