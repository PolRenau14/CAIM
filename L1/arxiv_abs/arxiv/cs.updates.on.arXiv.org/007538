Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and
economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart.
More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding
more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people
have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet
and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain
technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge
interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort
of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality,
nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope
with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze,
design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile
practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However,
it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the
system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method
is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.
