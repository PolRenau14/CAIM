Background: To understand individual genomes it is necessary to look at the variations that lead
to changes in phenotype and possibly to disease. However, genotype information alone is often not
sufficient and additional knowledge regarding the phase of the variation is needed to make correct
interpretations. Interactive visualizations, that allow the user to explore the data in various
ways, can be of great assistance in the process of making well informed decisions. But, currently
there is a lack for visualizations that are able to deal with phased haplotype data. Results: We present
inPHAP, an interactive visualization tool for genotype and phased haplotype data. inPHAP features
a variety of interaction possibilities such as zooming, sorting, filtering and aggregation of
rows in order to explore patterns hidden in large genetic data sets. As a proof of concept, we apply
inPHAP to the phased haplotype data set of Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project. Thereby, inPHAP's
ability to show genetic variations on the population as well as on the individuals level is demonstrated
for several disease related loci. Conclusions: As of today, inPHAP is the only visual analytical
tool that allows the user to explore unphased and phased haplotype data interactively. Due to its
highly scalable design, inPHAP can be applied to large datasets with up to 100 GB of data, enabling
users to visualize even large scale input data. inPHAP closes the gap between common visualization
tools for unphased genotype data and introduces several new features, such as the visualization
of phased data.
