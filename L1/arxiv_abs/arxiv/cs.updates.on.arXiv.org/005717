Adaptive bitrate streaming enables video users to adapt their playing bitrates to the real-time
network conditions, hence achieving the desirable quality-of-experience (QoE). In a multi-user
wireless scenario, however, existing single-user based bitrate adaptation methods may fail to
provide the desirable QoE, due to lack of consideration of multi-user interactions (such as the
multi-user interferences and network congestion). In this work, we propose a novel user cooperation
framework based on user-provided networking for multi-user mobile video streaming over wireless
cellular networks. The framework enables nearby mobile video users to crowdsource their cellular
links and resources for cooperative video streaming. We first analyze the social welfare performance
bound of the proposed cooperative streaming system by introducing a virtual time-slotted system.
Then, we design a low complexity Lyapunov-based online algorithm, which can be implemented in an
online and distributed manner without the complete future and global network information. Numerical
results show that the proposed online algorithm achieves an average 97% of the theoretical maximum
social welfare. We further conduct experiments with real data traces, to compare our proposed online
algorithm with the existing online algorithms in the literature. Experiment results show that
our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both the achievable bitrate (with
an average gain of 20% - 30%) and social welfare (with an average gain of 10% - 50%).
