Transactional memory allows the user to declare sequences of instructions as speculative \emph{transactions}
that can either \emph{commit} or \emph{abort}. If a transaction commits, it appears to be executed
sequentially, so that the committed transactions constitute a correct sequential execution.
If a transaction aborts, none of its instructions can affect other transactions. The popular criterion
of \emph{opacity} requires that the views of aborted transactions must also be consistent with
the global sequential order constituted by committed ones. This is believed to be important, since
inconsistencies observed by an aborted transaction may cause a fatal irrecoverable error or waste
of the system in an infinite loop. Intuitively, an opaque implementation must ensure that no intermediate
view a transaction obtains before it commits or aborts can be affected by a transaction that has not
started committing yet, so called \emph{deferred-update} semantics. In this paper, we intend
to grasp this intuition formally. We propose a variant of opacity that explicitly requires the sequential
order to respect the deferred-update semantics. %We show that our criterion is a safety property,
i.e., it is prefix- %and limit-closed. Unlike opacity, our property also ensures that a serialization
of a history implies serializations of its prefixes. Finally, we show that our property is equivalent
to opacity if we assume that no two transactions commit identical values on the same variable, and
present a counter-example for scenarios when the "unique-write" assumption does not hold.
