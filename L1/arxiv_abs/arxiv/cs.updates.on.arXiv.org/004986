Many Web platforms rely on user collaboration to generate high-quality content: Wiki, Q&A communities,
etc. Understanding and modeling the different collaborative behaviors is therefore critical.
However, collaboration patterns are difficult to capture when the relationships between users
are not directly observable, since they need to be inferred from the user actions. In this work, we
propose a solution to this problem by adopting a systemic view of collaboration. Rather than modeling
the users as independent actors in the system, we capture their coordinated actions with embedding
methods which can, in turn, identify shared objectives and predict future user actions. To validate
our approach, we perform a study on a dataset comprising more than 16M user actions, recorded on the
online collaborative sandbox Reddit r/place. Participants had access to a drawing canvas where
they could change the color of one pixel at every fixed time interval. Users were not grouped in teams
nor were given any specific goals, yet they organized themselves into a cohesive social fabric and
collaborated to the creation of a multitude of artworks. Our contribution in this paper is multi-fold:
i) we perform an in-depth analysis of the Reddit r/place collaborative sandbox, extracting insights
about its evolution over time; ii) we propose a predictive method that captures the latent structure
of the emergent collaborative efforts; and iii) we show that our method provides an interpretable
representation of the social structure.
