We present LOOM (Line-Ordering Optimized Maps), a fully automatic generator of geographically
accurate transit maps. The input to LOOM is data about the lines of a given transit network, namely
for each line, the sequence of stations it serves and the geographical course the vehicles of this
line take. We parse this data from GTFS, the prevailing standard for public transit data. LOOM proceeds
in three stages: (1) construct a so-called line graph, where edges correspond to segments of the
network with the same set of lines following the same course; (2) construct an ILP that yields a line
ordering for each edge which minimizes the total number of line crossings and line separations;
(3) based on the line graph and the ILP solution, draw the map. As a naive ILP formulation is too demanding,
we derive a new custom-tailored formulation which requires significantly fewer constraints.
Furthermore, we present engineering techniques which use structural properties of the line graph
to further reduce the ILP size. For the subway network of New York, we can reduce the number of constraints
from 229,000 in the naive ILP formulation to about 4,500 with our techniques, enabling solution
times of less than a second. Since our maps respect the geography of the transit network, they can
be used for tiles and overlays in typical map services. Previous research work either did not take
the geographical course of the lines into account, or was concerned with schematic maps without
optimizing line crossings or line separations.
