Hilbert's two-dimensional space-filling curve is appreciated for its good locality-preserving
properties and easy implementation for many applications. However, Hilbert did not describe how
to generalize his construction to higher dimensions. In fact, the number of ways in which this may
be done ranges from zero to infinite, depending on what properties of the Hilbert curve one considers
to be essential. In this work we take the point of view that a Hilbert curve should at least be self-similar
and traverse cubes octant by octant. We organize and explore the space of possible three-dimensional
Hilbert curves and the potentially useful properties which they may have. We discuss a notation
system that allows us to distinguish the curves from one another and enumerate them. This system
has been implemented in a software prototype, available from the author's website. Several examples
of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves are presented, including a curve that visits the
points on most sides of the unit cube in the order of the two-dimensional Hilbert curve; curves of
which not only the eight octants are similar to each other, but also the four quarters; a curve with
excellent locality-preserving properties and endpoints that are not vertices of the cube; a curve
in which all but two octants are each other's images with respect to reflections in axis-parallel
planes; and curves that can be sketched on a grid without using vertical line segments. In addition,
we discuss several four-dimensional Hilbert curves.
