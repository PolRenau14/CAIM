Swarm robotic systems are currently being used to address many real-world problems. One interesting
application of swarm robotics is the self-organized formation of structures and shapes. Some of
the key challenges in the swarm robotic systems include swarm size constraint, random motion, coordination
among robots, localization, and adaptability in a decentralized environment. Rubenstein et al.
presented a system ("Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm", Science, 2014) for
thousand-robot swarm able to form only solid shapes with the robots in aggregated form by applying
the collective behavior algorithm. Even though agent-based approaches have been presented in
various studies for self-organized formation, however these studies lack agent-based modeling
(ABM) approach along with the constraints in term of structure complexity and heterogeneity in
large swarms with dynamic localization. The cognitive agent-based computing (CABC) approach
is capable of modeling such self-organization based multi-agents systems (MAS). In this paper,
we develop a simulation model using ABM under CABC approach for self-organized shape formation
in swarm robots. We propose a shape formation algorithm for validating our model and perform simulation-based
experiments for six different shapes including hole-based shapes. We also demonstrate the formal
specification for our model. The simulation result shows the robustness of the proposed approach
having the emergent behavior of robots for the self-organized shape formation. The performance
of the proposed approach is evaluated by robots convergence rate.
