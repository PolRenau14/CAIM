Software engineers often have to estimate the performance of a software system before having full
knowledge of the system parameters, such as workload and operational profile. These uncertain
parameters inevitably affect the accuracy of quality evaluations, and the ability to judge if the
system can continue to fulfil performance requirements if parameter results are different from
expected. Previous work has addressed this problem by modelling the potential values of uncertain
parameters as probability distribution functions, and estimating the robustness of the system
using Monte Carlo-based methods. These approaches require a large number of samples, which results
in high computational cost and long waiting times. To address the computational inefficiency of
existing approaches, we employ Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) as a rigorous method for uncertainty
propagation and further extend its use to robust performance estimation. The aim is to assess if
the software system is robust, i.e., it can withstand possible changes in parameter values, and
continue to meet performance requirements. PCE is a very efficient technique, and requires significantly
less computations to accurately estimate the distribution of performance indices. Through three
very different case studies from different phases of software development and heterogeneous application
domains, we show that PCE can accurately (>97\%) estimate the robustness of various performance
indices, and saves up to 225 hours of performance evaluation time when compared to Monte Carlo Simulation.
