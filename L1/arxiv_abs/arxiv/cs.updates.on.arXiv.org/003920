Nowadays with the help of advanced technology, modern vehicles are not only made up of mechanical
devices but also consist of highly complex electronic devices and connections to the outside world.
There are around 70 Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in modern vehicle which are communicating with
each other over the standard communication protocol known as Controller Area Network (CAN-Bus)
that provides the communication rate up to 1Mbps. There are different types of in-vehicle network
protocol and bus system namely Controlled Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnected Network (LIN),
Media Oriented System Transport (MOST), and FlexRay. Even though CAN-Bus is considered as de-facto
standard for in-vehicle network communication, it inherently lacks the fundamental security
features by design like message authentication. This security limitation has paved the way for
adversaries to penetrate into the vehicle network and do malicious activities which can pose a dangerous
situation for both driver and passengers. In particular, nowadays vehicular networks are not only
closed systems, but also they are open to different external interfaces namely Bluetooth, GPS,
to the outside world. Therefore, it creates new opportunities for attackers to remotely take full
control of the vehicle. The objective of this research is to survey the current limitations of CAN-Bus
protocol in terms of secure communication and different solutions that researchers in the society
of automotive have provided to overcome the CAN-Bus limitation on different layers.
