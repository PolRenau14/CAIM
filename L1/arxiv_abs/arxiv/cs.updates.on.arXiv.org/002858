The blockchain initially gained traction in 2008 as the technology underlying bitcoin, but now
has been employed in a diverse range of applications and created a global market worth over $150B
as of 2017. What distinguishes blockchains from traditional distributed databases is the ability
to operate in a decentralized setting without relying on a trusted third party. As such their core
technical component is consensus: how to reach agreement among a group of nodes. This has been extensively
studied already in the distributed systems community for closed systems, but its application to
open blockchains has revitalized the field and led to a plethora of new designs. The inherent complexity
of consensus protocols and their rapid and dramatic evolution makes it hard to contextualize the
design landscape. We address this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study
of blockchain consensus protocols. After first discussing key themes in classical consensus protocols,
we describe: first protocols based on proof-of-work (PoW), second proof-of-X (PoX) protocols
that replace PoW with more energy-efficient alternatives, and third hybrid protocols that are
compositions or variations of classical consensus protocols. We develop a framework to evaluate
their performance, security and design properties, and use it to systematize key themes in the protocol
categories described above. This evaluation leads us to identify research gaps and challenges
for the community to consider in future research endeavours.
