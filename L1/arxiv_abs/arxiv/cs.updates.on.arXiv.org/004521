Changes in travel modes used by people, particularly reduction of the private car use, is an important
determinant of effectiveness of transportation plans. Because of dependencies between the choices
of residential location and travel mode, integrated modelling of these choices has been proposed
by some researchers. In this paper, an agent-based microsimulation model has been developed to
evaluate impacts of different transport development plans on choices of residential location
and commuting mode of tenant households in Tehran, the capital of Iran. In the proposed model, households
are considered as agents who select their desired residential location using a constrained NSGA-II
algorithm and in a competition with other households. In addition, they choose their commuting
mode by applying a multi-criteria decision making method. Afterwards, effects of development
of a new highway, subway and bus rapid transit (BRT) line on their residential location and commuting
mode choices are evaluated. Results show that despite the residential self-selection effects,
these plans result in considerable changes in the commuting mode of different socioeconomic categories
of households. Development of the new subway line shows promising results by reducing the private
car use among the all socio-economic categories of households. But the new highway development
unsatisfactorily results in increase in the private car use. In addition, development of the new
BRT line does not show significant effects on the commuting mode change, particularly on decrease
in the private car use.
