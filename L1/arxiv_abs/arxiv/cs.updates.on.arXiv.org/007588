Algorithms for the synchronisation of clocks across networks are both common and important within
distributed systems. We here address not only the formal modelling of these algorithms, but also
the formal verification of their behaviour. Of particular importance is the strong link between
the very different levels of abstraction at which the algorithms may be verified. Our contribution
is primarily the formalisation of this connection between individual models and population-based
models, and the subsequent verification that is then possible. While the technique is applicable
across a range of synchronisation algorithms, we particularly focus on the synchronisation of
(biologically-inspired) pulse-coupled oscillators, a widely used approach in practical distributed
systems. For this application domain, different levels of abstraction are crucial: models based
on the behaviour of an individual process are able to capture the details of distinguished nodes
in possibly heterogenous networks, where each node may exhibit different behaviour. On the other
hand, collective models assume homogeneous sets of processes, and allow the behaviour of the network
to be analysed at the global level. System-wide parameters may be easily adjusted, for example environmental
factors inhibiting the reliability of the shared communication medium. This work provides a formal
bridge across the abstraction gap separating the individual models and the population-based models
for this important class of synchronisation algorithms.
