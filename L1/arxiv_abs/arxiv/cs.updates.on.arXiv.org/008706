SMILES is a linear representation of chemical structures which encodes the connection table, and
the stereochemistry of a molecule as a line of text with a grammar structure denoting atoms, bonds,
rings and chains, and this information can be used to predict chemical properties. Molecular fingerprints
are representations of chemical structures, successfully used in similarity search, clustering,
classification, drug discovery, and virtual screening and are a standard and computationally
efficient abstract representation where structural features are represented as a bit string.
Both SMILES and molecular fingerprints are different representations for describing the structure
of a molecule. There exist several predictive models for learning chemical properties based on
either SMILES or molecular fingerprints. Here, our goal is to build predictive models that can leverage
both these molecular representations. In this work, we present CheMixNet -- a set of neural networks
for predicting chemical properties from a mixture of features learned from the two molecular representations
-- SMILES as sequences and molecular fingerprints as vector inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy
of CheMixNet architectures by evaluating on six different datasets. The proposed CheMixNet models
not only outperforms the candidate neural architectures such as contemporary fully connected
networks that uses molecular fingerprints and 1-D CNN and RNN models trained SMILES sequences,
but also other state-of-the-art architectures such as Chemception and Molecular Graph Convolutions.
