Cross-institutional healthcare predictive modeling can accelerate research and facilitate
quality improvement initiatives, and thus is important for national healthcare delivery priorities.
For example, a model that predicts risk of re-admission for a particular set of patients will be more
generalizable if developed with data from multiple institutions. While privacy-protecting methods
to build predictive models exist, most are based on a centralized architecture, which presents
security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure (and single-point-of-breach)
and accidental or malicious modification of records. In this article, we describe a new framework,
ModelChain, to adapt Blockchain technology for privacy-preserving machine learning. Each participating
site contributes to model parameter estimation without revealing any patient health information
(i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across institutions). We integrate
privacy-preserving online machine learning with a private Blockchain network, apply transaction
metadata to disseminate partial models, and design a new proof-of-information algorithm to determine
the order of the online learning process. We also discuss the benefits and potential issues of applying
Blockchain technology to solve the privacy-preserving healthcare predictive modeling task and
to increase interoperability between institutions, to support the Nationwide Interoperability
Roadmap and national healthcare delivery priorities such as Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
(PCOR).
