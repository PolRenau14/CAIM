Many important graph theoretic notions can be encoded as counting graph homomorphism problems,
such as partition functions in statistical physics, in particular, independent sets and colourings.
In this article we study the complexity of $\#_p\mathsf{H}$OMS$\mathsf{T}$O$H$, the problem
of counting graph homomorphisms from an input graph to a graph $H$ modulo a prime number $p$. Dyer
and Greenhill proved a dichotomy stating that the tractability of non-modular counting graph homomorphisms
depends on the structure of the input graph. Many intractable cases in non-modular counting become
tractable in modular counting due to the common phenomenon of cancellation. However, in subsequent
studies on counting modulo $2$ the influence, the structure of $H$ has on the tractability, was shown
to persist, yielding similar dichotomies. Our main result shows that for every tree $H$ and every
prime $p$ the problem $\#_p\mathsf{H}$OMS$\mathsf{T}$O$H$ is either polynomial time computable
or $\#_p\mathsf{P}$-complete. This addresses the conjecture of Faben and Jerrum stating this
dichotomy for every graph $H$ when counting modulo 2. In order to prove this result, we study the structural
properties of a homomorphism. As an important interim, this study yields a dichotomy for the problem
of weighted counting independent sets in a bipartite graph modulo some prime $p$. Our results are
the first suggesting that such dichotomies hold not only for the one-bit functions of the modulo~2
case but for the modular counting functions of all primes $p$.
