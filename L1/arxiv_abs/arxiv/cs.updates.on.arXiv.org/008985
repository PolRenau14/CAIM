A multilayer perceptron can behave as a generative classifier by applying bidirectional learning
(BL). It consists of training an undirected neural network to map input to output and vice-versa;
therefore it can produce a classifier in one direction, and a generator in the opposite direction
for the same data. The learning process of BL tries to reproduce the neuroplasticity stated in Hebbian
theory using only backward propagation of errors. In this paper, two novel learning techniques
are introduced which use BL for improving robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples.
The first method is bidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in
backward and forward directions. Motivated by the fact that its generative model receives as input
a constant vector per class, we introduce as a second method the hybrid adversarial networks (HAN).
Its generative model receives a random vector as input and its training is based on generative adversarial
networks (GAN). To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using several architectures
with fully and convolutional layers, with and without bias. Experimental results show that both
methods improve robustness to white noise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy,
but have different behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more beneficial to use
the one or the other. Nevertheless, HAN using a convolutional architecture with batch normalization
presents outstanding robustness, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy on adversarial examples
of hand-written digits.
