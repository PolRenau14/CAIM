Distributed, online data mining systems have emerged as a result of applications requiring analysis
of large amounts of correlated and high-dimensional data produced by multiple distributed data
sources. We propose a distributed online data classification framework where data is gathered
by distributed data sources and processed by a heterogeneous set of distributed learners which
learn online, at run-time, how to classify the different data streams either by using their locally
available classification functions or by helping each other by classifying each other's data.
Importantly, since the data is gathered at different locations, sending the data to another learner
to process incurs additional costs such as delays, and hence this will be only beneficial if the benefits
obtained from a better classification will exceed the costs. We assume that the classification
functions available to each processing element are fixed, but their prediction accuracy for various
types of incoming data are unknown and can change dynamically over time, and thus they need to be learned
online. We model the problem of joint classification by the distributed and heterogeneous learners
from multiple data sources as a distributed contextual bandit problem where each data is characterized
by a specific context. We develop distributed online learning algorithms for which we can prove
that they have sublinear regret. Compared to prior work in distributed online data mining, our work
is the first to provide analytic regret results characterizing the performance of the proposed
algorithms.
