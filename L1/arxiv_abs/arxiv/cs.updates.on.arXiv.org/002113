Distributed cloud networking enables the deployment of a wide range of services in the form of interconnected
software functions instantiated over general purpose hardware at multiple cloud locations distributed
throughout the network. We consider the problem of optimal service delivery over a distributed
cloud network, in which nodes are equipped with both communication and computation resources.
We address the design of distributed online solutions that drive flow processing and routing decisions,
along with the associated allocation of cloud and network resources. For a given set of services,
each described by a chain of service functions, we characterize the cloud network capacity region
and design a family of dynamic cloud network control (DCNC) algorithms that stabilize the underlying
queuing system, while achieving arbitrarily close to minimum cost with a tradeoff in network delay.
The proposed DCNC algorithms make local decisions based on the online minimization of linear and
quadratic metrics obtained from an upper bound on the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty of the cloud
network queuing system. Minimizing a quadratic vs. a linear metric is shown to improve the cost-delay
tradeoff at the expense of increased computational complexity. Our algorithms are further enhanced
with a shortest transmission-plus-processing distance bias that improves delay performance
without compromising throughput or overall cloud network cost. We provide throughput and cost
optimality guarantees, convergence time analysis, and extensive simulations in representative
cloud network scenarios.
