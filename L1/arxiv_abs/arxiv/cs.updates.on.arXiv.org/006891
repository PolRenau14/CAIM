Extracting textual features from tweets is a challenging process due to the noisy nature of the content
and the weak signal of most of the words used. In this paper, we propose using singular value decomposition
(SVD) with clustering to enhance the signals of the textual features in the tweets to improve the
correlation with events. The proposed technique applies SVD to the time series vector for each feature
to factorize the matrix of feature/day counts, in order to ensure the independence of the feature
vectors. Afterwards, the k-means clustering is applied to build a look-up table that maps members
of each cluster to the cluster-centroid. The lookup table is used to map each feature in the original
data to the centroid of its cluster, then we calculate the sum of the term frequency vectors of all
features in each cluster to the term-frequency-vector of the cluster centroid. To test the technique
we calculated the correlations of the cluster centroids with the golden standard record (GSR) vector
before and after summing the vectors of the cluster members to the centroid-vector. The proposed
method is applied to multiple correlation techniques including the Pearson, Spearman, distance
correlation and Kendal Tao. The experiments have also considered the different word forms and lengths
of the features including keywords, n-grams, skip-grams and bags-of-words. The correlation results
are enhanced significantly as the highest correlation scores have increased from 0.3 to 0.6, and
the average correlation scores have increased from 0.3 to 0.4.
