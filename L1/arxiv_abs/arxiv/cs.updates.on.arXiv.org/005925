One of the main advantages of Prolog is its potential for the implicit exploitation of parallelism
and, as a high-level language, Prolog is also often used as a means to explicitly control concurrent
tasks. Tabling is a powerful implementation technique that overcomes some limitations of traditional
Prolog systems in dealing with recursion and redundant sub-computations. Given these advantages,
the question that arises is if tabling has also the potential for the exploitation of concurrency/parallelism.
On one hand, tabling still exploits a search space as traditional Prolog but, on the other hand, the
concurrent model of tabling is necessarily far more complex since it also introduces concurrency
on the access to the tables. In this paper, we summarize Yap's main contributions to concurrent tabled
evaluation and we describe the design and implementation challenges of several alternative table
space designs for implicit and explicit concurrent tabled evaluation which represent different
trade-offs between concurrency and memory usage. We also motivate for the advantages of using fixed-size
and lock-free data structures, elaborate on the key role that the engine's memory allocator plays
on such environments, and discuss how Yap's mode-directed tabling support can be extended to concurrent
evaluation. Finally, we present our future perspectives towards an efficient and novel concurrent
framework which integrates both implicit and explicit concurrent tabled evaluation in a single
Prolog engine. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
