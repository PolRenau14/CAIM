The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to help solve a wide range of issues that relate to our wellbeing
within application domains that include smart cities, healthcare monitoring, and environmental
monitoring. IoT is bringing new wireless sensor use cases by taking advantage of the computing power
and flexibility provided by Edge and Cloud Computing. However, the software and hardware resources
used within such applications must perform correctly and optimally. Especially in applications
where a failure of resources can be critical. Service Level Agreements (SLA) where the performance
requirements of such applications are defined, need to be specified in a standard way that reflects
the end-to-end nature of IoT application domains, accounting for the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics
within every layer including the Edge, Network Gateways, and Cloud. In this paper, we propose a conceptual
model that captures the key entities of an SLA and their relationships, as a prior step for end-to-end
SLA specification and composition. Service level objective (SLO) terms are also considered to
express the QoS constraints. Moreover, we propose a new SLA grammar which considers workflow activities
and the multi-layered nature of IoT applications. Accordingly, we develop a tool for SLA specification
and composition that can be used as a template to generate SLAs in a machine-readable format. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed specification language through a literature survey that includes
an SLA language comparison analysis, and via reflecting the user satisfaction results of a usability
study.
