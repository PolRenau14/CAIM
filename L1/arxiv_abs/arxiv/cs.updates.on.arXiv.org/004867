Face multi-attribute prediction benefits substantially from multi-task learning (MTL), which
learns multiple face attributes simultaneously to achieve shared or mutually related representations
of different attributes. The most widely used MTL convolutional neural network is heuristically
or empirically designed by sharing all of the convolutional layers and splitting at the fully connected
layers for task-specific losses. However, it is improper to view all low and mid-level features
for different attributes as being the same, especially when these attributes are only loosely related.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-attribute tensor correlation neural network (MTCN) for
face attribute prediction. The structure shares the information in low-level features (e.g.,
the first two convolutional layers) but splits that in high-level features (e.g., from the third
convolutional layer to the fully connected layer). At the same time, during high-level feature
extraction, each subnetwork (e.g., Age-Net, Gender-Net, ..., and Smile-Net) excavates closely
related features from other networks to enhance its features. Then, we project the features of the
C9 layers of the fine-tuned subnetworks into a highly correlated space by using a novel tensor correlation
analysis algorithm (NTCCA). The final face attribute prediction is made based on the correlation
matrix. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes (CelebA and LFWA) show
that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
