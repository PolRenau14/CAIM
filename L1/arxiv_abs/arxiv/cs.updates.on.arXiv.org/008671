To understand the spatial deployment of base stations (BSs) is the first step to analyze the performance
of cellular networks and further design efficient networking protocols. Poisson point process
(PPP), which has been widely adopted to characterize the deployment of BSs and established the reputation
to give tractable results in the stochastic geometry analyses, usually assumes a static BS deployment
density in homogeneous PPP (HPPP) models or delicately designed location-dependent density functions
in in-homogeneous PPP (IPPP) models. However, the simultaneous existence of attractiveness and
repulsiveness among BSs practically deployed in a large-scale area defies such an assumption,
and the $\alpha$-stable distribution, one kind of heavy-tailed distributions, has recently demonstrated
superior accuracy to statistically model the varying BS density in different areas. In this paper,
we start with these new findings and investigate the intrinsic feature (i.e., the spatial self-similarity)
embedded in the BSs. Afterwards, we refer to a generalized PPP setup with $\alpha$-stable distributed
density and theoretically derive the related coverage probability. In particular, we give an upper
bound of the derived coverage probability for high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) thresholds and show the monotonically decreasing property of this bound with respect to
the variance of BS density. Besides, we prove that our model could reduce to the single-tier HPPP
for some special cases, and demonstrate the superior accuracy of the $\alpha$-stable model to approach
the real environment.
