In multi-channel Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), each node is able to use multiple non-overlapping
frequency channels. Raniwala et al. (MC2R 2004, INFOCOM 2005) propose and study several such architectures
in which a computer can have multiple network interface cards. These architectures are modeled
as a graph problem named \emph{maximum edge $q$-coloring} and studied in several papers by Feng
et. al (TAMC 2007), Adamaszek and Popa (ISAAC 2010, JDA 2016). Later on Larjomaa and Popa (IWOCA 2014,
JGAA 2015) define and study an alternative variant, named the \emph{min-max edge $q$-coloring}.
The above mentioned graph problems, namely the maximum edge $q$-coloring and the min-max edge $q$-coloring
are studied mainly from the theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study the min-max edge 2-coloring
problem from a practical perspective. More precisely, we introduce, implement and test four heuristic
approximation algorithms for the min-max edge $2$-coloring problem. These algorithms are based
on a \emph{Breadth First Search} (BFS)-based heuristic and on \emph{local search} methods like
basic \emph{hill climbing}, \emph{simulated annealing} and \emph{tabu search} techniques,
respectively. Although several algorithms for particular graph classes were proposed by Larjomaa
and Popa (e.g., trees, planar graphs, cliques, bi-cliques, hypergraphs), we design the first algorithms
for general graphs. We study and compare the running data for all algorithms on Unit Disk Graphs,
as well as some graphs from the DIMACS vertex coloring benchmark dataset.
