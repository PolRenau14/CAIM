The Semantic Web aims at representing knowledge about the real world at web scale - things, their
attributes and relationships among them can be represented as nodes and edges in an inter-linked
semantic graph. In the presence of noisy data, as is typical of data on the Semantic Web, a software
Agent needs to be able to robustly infer one or more associated actionable classes for the individuals
in order to act automatically on it. We model this problem as a multi-label classification task where
we want to robustly identify types of the individuals in a semantic graph such as DBpedia, which we
use as an exemplary dataset on the Semantic Web. Our approach first extracts multiple features for
the individuals using random walks and then performs multi-label classification using fully-connected
Neural Networks. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, we identify the effect
of hyper-parameters of the feature extraction and the fully-connected Neural Network structure
on the classification performance. Our final results show that our method performs better than
state-of-the-art inferencing systems like SDtype and SLCN, from which we can conclude that random-walk-based
feature extraction of individuals and their multi-label classification using Deep Neural Networks
is a promising alternative to these systems for type classification of individuals on the Semantic
Web. The main contribution of our work is to introduce a novel approach that allows us to use Deep Neural
Networks to identify types of individuals in a noisy semantic graph by extracting features using
random walks
