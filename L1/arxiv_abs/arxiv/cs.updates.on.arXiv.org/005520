Today's emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios are characterized by the exchange
of data between services across enterprises. Traditional access and usage control mechanisms
are only able to determine if data may be used by a subject, but lack an understanding of how it may be
used. The ability to control the way how data is processed is however crucial for enterprises to guarantee
(and provide evidence of) compliant processing of critical data, as well as for users who need to
control if their private data may be analyzed or linked with additional information - a major concern
in IoT applications processing personal information. In this paper, we introduce LUCON, a data-centric
security policy framework for distributed systems that considers data flows by controlling how
messages may be routed across services and how they are combined and processed. LUCON policies prevent
information leaks, bind data usage to obligations, and enforce data flows across services. Policy
enforcement is based on a dynamic taint analysis at runtime and an upfront static verification of
message routes against policies. We discuss the semantics of these two complementing enforcement
models and illustrate how LUCON policies are compiled from a simple policy language into a first-order
logic representation. We demonstrate the practical application of LUCON in a real-world IoT middleware
and discuss its integration into Apache Camel. Finally, we evaluate the runtime impact of LUCON
and discuss performance and scalability aspects.
