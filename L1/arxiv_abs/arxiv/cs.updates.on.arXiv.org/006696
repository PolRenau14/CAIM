Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has
attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built
on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates
by constructing complex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image features with high-level
context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning,
more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced
to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently
in network architecture, training strategy and optimization function, etc. In this paper, we provide
a review on deep learning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction
on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications
and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks
exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including
salient object detection, face detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are
also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several
promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object
detection and relevant neural network based learning systems.
