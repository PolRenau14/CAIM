Embedded software is growing fast in size and complexity, leading to intimate mixture of complex
architectures and complex control. Consequently, software specification requires modeling
both structures and behaviour of systems. Unfortunately, existing languages do not integrate
these aspects well, usually prioritizing one of them. It is common to develop a separate language
for each of these facets. In this paper, we contribute Clafer: a small language that attempts to tackle
this challenge. It combines rich structural modeling with state of the art behavioural formalisms.
We are not aware of any other modeling language that seamlessly combines these facets common to system
and software modeling. We show how Clafer, in a single unified syntax and semantics, allows capturing
feature models (variability), component models, discrete control models (automata) and variability
encompassing all these aspects. The language is built on top of first order logic with quantifiers
over basic entities (for modeling structures) combined with linear temporal logic (for modeling
behaviour). On top of this semantic foundation we build a simple but expressive syntax, enriched
with carefully selected syntactic expansions that cover hierarchical modeling, associations,
automata, scenarios, and Dwyer's property patterns. We evaluate Clafer using a power window case
study, and comparing it against other notations that substantially overlap with its scope (SysML,
AADL, Temporal OCL and Live Sequence Charts), discussing benefits and perils of using a single notation
for the purpose.
