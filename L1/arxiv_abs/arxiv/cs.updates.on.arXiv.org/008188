Decoding EEG signals of different mental states is a challenging task for brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) due to nonstationarity of perceptual decision processes. This paper presents a novel boosted
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) decoding scheme for motor imagery (MI) EEG signals assisted
by the multiwavelet-based time-frequency (TF) causality analysis. Specifically, multiwavelet
basis functions are first combined with Geweke spectral measure to obtain high-resolution TF-conditional
Granger causality (CGC) representations, where a regularized orthogonal forward regression
(ROFR) algorithm is adopted to detect a parsimonious model with good generalization performance.
The causality images for network input preserving time, frequency and location information of
connectivity are then designed based on the TF-CGC distributions of alpha band multichannel EEG
signals. Further constructed boosted ConvNets by using spatio-temporal convolutions as well
as advances in deep learning including cropping and boosting methods, to extract discriminative
causality features and classify MI tasks. Our proposed approach outperforms the competition winner
algorithm with 12.15% increase in average accuracy and 74.02% decrease in associated inter subject
standard deviation for the same binary classification on BCI competition-IV dataset-IIa. Experiment
results indicate that the boosted ConvNets with causality images works well in decoding MI-EEG
signals and provides a promising framework for developing MI-BCI systems.
