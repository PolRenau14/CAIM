Background: Requirement engineering is often considered a critical activity in system development
projects. The increasing complexity of software, as well as number and heterogeneity of stakeholders,
motivate the development of methods and tools for improving large-scale requirement engineering.
Aims: The empirical study presented in this paper aims to identify and understand the characteristics
and challenges of a platform, as desired by experts, to support requirement engineering for individual
stakeholders, based on the current pain-points of their organizations when dealing with a large
number requirements. Method: We conducted a multiple case study with three companies in different
domains. We collected data through ten semi-structured interviews with experts from these companies.
Results: The main pain-point for stakeholders is handling the vast amount of data from different
sources. The foreseen platform should leverage such data to manage changes in requirements according
to customers' and users' preferences. It should also offer stakeholders an estimation of how long
a requirements engineering task will take to complete, along with an easier requirements dependency
identification and requirements reuse strategy. Conclusions: The findings provide empirical
evidence about how practitioners wish to improve their requirement engineering processes and
tools. The insights are a starting point for in-depth investigations into the problems and solutions
presented. Practitioners can use the results to improve existing or design new practices and tools.
