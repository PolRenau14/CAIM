Airborne discrete return light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds covering forested areas
can be processed to segment individual trees and retrieve their morphological attributes. Segmenting
individual trees in natural deciduous forests however remained a challenge because of the complex
and multi-layered canopy. In this chapter, we present (i) a robust segmentation method that avoids
a priori assumptions about the canopy structure, (ii) a vertical canopy stratification procedure
that improves segmentation of understory trees, (iii) an occlusion model for estimating the point
density of each canopy stratum, and (iv) a distributed computing approach for efficient processing
at the forest level. When applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, the segmentation
method detected about 90% of overstory and 47% of understory trees with over-segmentation rates
of 14% and 2%. Stratifying the canopy improved the detection rate of understory trees to 68% at the
cost of increasing their over-segmentations to 16%. According to our occlusion model, a point density
of ~170 pt/m-sqr is needed to segment understory trees as accurately as overstory trees. Lastly,
using the distributed approach, we segmented about two million trees in the 7,440-ha forest in 2.5
hours using 192 processors, which is 167 times faster than using a single processor. Keywords: individual
