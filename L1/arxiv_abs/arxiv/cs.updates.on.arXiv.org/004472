In big data era, machine learning is one of fundamental techniques in intrusion detection systems
(IDSs). However, practical IDSs generally update their decision module by feeding new data then
retraining learning models in a periodical way. Hence, some attacks that comprise the data for training
or testing classifiers significantly challenge the detecting capability of machine learning-based
IDSs. Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized security threats towards machine learning-based
IDSs, injects some adversarial samples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training
data and a significant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this paper, we adopt
the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel poisoning method that attack against
several machine learning algorithms used in IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern
detection algorithm to efficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered
to be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD Boundary Pattern (BEBP)
detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the number of edge pattern points generated by
EPD and to obtain more useful adversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but
effective poisoning method called chronic poisoning attack. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and three real network data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed poisoning method against
several well-known machine learning algorithms and a practical intrusion detection method named
FMIFS-LSSVM-IDS.
