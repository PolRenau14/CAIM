The amount of data generated by scientific and commercial applications is growing at an ever-increasing
pace. This data is often moved between geographically distributed sites for various purposes such
as collaboration and backup which has led to significant increase in data transfer rates. Surge
in data transfer rates when combined with proliferation of scientific applications that cannot
tolerate data corruption triggered enhanced integrity verification techniques to be developed.
End-to-end integrity verification minimizes the likelihood of silent data corruption by comparing
checksum of files at source and destination servers using secure hash algorithms such as MD5 and
SHA1. However, it imposes significant performance penalty due to overhead of checksum computation.
In this paper, we propose Fast Integrity VERification (FIVER) algorithm which overlaps checksum
computation and data transfer operations of files to minimize the cost of integrity verification.
Extensive experiments show that FIVER is able to bring down the cost from 60% by the state-of-the-art
solutions to below 10% by concurrently executing transfer and checksum operations and enabling
file I/O share between them. We also implemented FIVER-Hybrid to mimic disk access patterns of sequential
integrity verification approach to capture possible data corruption that may occur during file
write operations which FIVER may miss. Results show that FIVER-Hybrid is able to reduce execution
time by 20% compared to sequential approach without compromising the reliability of integrity
verification.
