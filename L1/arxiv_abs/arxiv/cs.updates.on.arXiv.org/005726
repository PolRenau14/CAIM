Similarity measure as a fundamental task in heterogeneous information network analysis has been
applied to many areas, e.g., product recommendation, clustering and Web search. Most of the existing
metrics depend on the meta-path or meta-structure specified by users in advance. These metrics
are thus sensitive to the pre-specified meta-path or meta-structure. In this paper, a novel similarity
measure in heterogeneous information networks, called Recurrent Meta-Structure-based Similarity
(RMSS), is proposed. The recurrent meta-structure as a schematic structure in heterogeneous information
networks provides a unified framework to integrate all of the meta-paths and meta-structures.
Therefore, RMSS is robust to the meta-paths and meta-structures. We devise an approach to automatically
constructing the recurrent meta-structure. In order to formalize the semantics, the recurrent
meta-structure is decomposed into several recurrent meta-paths and recurrent meta-trees, and
we then define the commuting matrices of the recurrent meta-paths and meta-trees. All of the commuting
matrices of the recurrent meta-paths and meta-trees are combined according to different weights.
Note that the weights can be determined by two kinds of weighting strategies: local weighting strategy
and global weighting strategy. As a result, RMSS is defined by virtue of the final commuting matrix.
Experimental evaluations show that the existing metrics are sensitive to different meta-paths
or meta-structures and that the proposed RMSS outperforms the existing metrics in terms of ranking
and clustering tasks.
