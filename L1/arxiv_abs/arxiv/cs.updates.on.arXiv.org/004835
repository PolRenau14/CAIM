There is an emerging consensus in the scientific software community that progress in scientific
research is dependent on the "quality and accessibility of software at all levels" (wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/).
This progress depends on embracing the best traditional---and emergent---practices in software
engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the more formal tradition of software
engineering. As a first step in our larger exploratory project to study in-process quality metrics
for software development projects in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), we have developed
the Metrics Dashboard, a platform for producing and observing metrics by mining open-source software
repositories on GitHub. Unlike GitHub and similar systems that provide individual performance
metrics (e.g. commits), the Metrics Dashboard focuses on metrics indicative of team progress and
project health. The Metrics Dashboard allows the user to submit the URL of a hosted repository for
batch analysis, whose results are then cached. Upon completion, the user can interactively study
various metrics over time (at varying granularity), numerically and visually. The initial version
of the system is up and running as a public cloud service (SaaS) and supports project size (KLOC),
defect density, defect spoilage, and productivity. While our system is by no means the first to support
software metrics, we believe it may be one of the first community-focused extensible resources
that can be used by any hosted project.
