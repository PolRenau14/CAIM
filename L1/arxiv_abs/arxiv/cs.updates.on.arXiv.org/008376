With the expeditious advancement of information technologies, health-related data presented
unprecedented potentials for medical and health discoveries but at the same time significant challenges
for machine learning techniques both in terms of size and complexity. Those challenges include:
the structured data with various storage formats and value types caused by heterogeneous data sources;
the uncertainty widely existing in every aspect of medical diagnosis and treatments; the high dimensionality
of the feature space; the longitudinal medical records data with irregular intervals between adjacent
observations; the richness of relations existing among objects with similar genetic factors,
location or socio-demographic background. This thesis aims to develop advanced Statistical Relational
Learning approaches in order to effectively exploit such health-related data and facilitate the
discoveries in medical research. It presents the work on cost-sensitive statistical relational
learning for mining structured imbalanced data, the first continuous-time probabilistic logic
model for predicting sequential events from longitudinal structured data as well as hybrid probabilistic
relational models for learning from heterogeneous structured data. It also demonstrates the outstanding
performance of these proposed models as well as other state of the art machine learning models when
applied to medical research problems and other real-world large-scale systems, reveals the great
potential of statistical relational learning for exploring the structured health-related data
to facilitate medical research.
