Decentralized Web, or DWeb, is envisioned as a promising future of the Web. Being decentralized,
there are no dedicated web servers in DWeb; Devices that retrieve web contents also serve their cached
data to peer devices with straight privacy-preserving mechanisms. The fact that contents in DWeb
are distributed, replicated, and decentralized lead to a number of key advantages over the conventional
web. These include better resiliency against network partitioning and distributed-denial-of-service
attacks (DDoS), and better browsing experiences in terms of shorter latency and higher throughput.
Moreover, DWeb provides tamper-proof contents because each content piece is uniquely identified
by a cryptographic hash. DWeb also clicks well with future Internet architectures, such as Named
Data Networking (NDN).Search engines have been an inseparable element of the Web. Contemporary
("Web 2.0") search engines, however, provide centralized services. They are thus subject to DDoS
attacks, insider threat, and ethical issues like search bias and censorship. As the web moves from
being centralized to being decentralized, search engines ought to follow. We propose QueenBee,
a decentralized search engine for DWeb. QueenBee is so named because worker bees and honeycomb are
a common metaphor for distributed architectures, with the queen being the one that holds the colony
together. QueenBee aims to revolutionize the search engine business model by offering incentives
to both content providers and peers that participate in QueenBee's page indexing and ranking operations.
