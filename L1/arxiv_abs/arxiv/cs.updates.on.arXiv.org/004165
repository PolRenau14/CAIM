Let $G$ be a finite simple graph. For $X \subset V(G)$, the difference of $X$, $d(X) := |X| - |N (X)|$
where $N(X)$ is the neighborhood of $X$ and $\max \, \{d(X):X\subset V(G)\}$ is called the critical
difference of $G$. $X$ is called a critical set if $d(X)$ equals the critical difference and ker$(G)$
is the intersection of all critical sets. It is known that ker$(G)$ is an independent (vertex) set
of $G$. diadem$(G)$ is the union of all critical independent sets. An independent set $S$ is an inclusion
minimal set with $d(S) > 0$ if no proper subset of $S$ has positive difference. A graph $G$ is called
K\"onig-Egerv\'ary if the sum of its independence number ($\alpha (G)$) and matching number ($\mu
(G)$) equals $|V(G)|$. It is known that bipartite graphs are K\"onig-Egerv\'ary. In this paper,
we study independent sets with positive difference for which every proper subset has a smaller difference
and prove a result conjectured by Levit and Mandrescu in 2013. The conjecture states that for any
graph, the number of inclusion minimal sets $S$ with $d(S) > 0$ is at least the critical difference
of the graph. We also give a short proof of the inequality $|$ker$(G)| + |$diadem$(G)| \le 2\alpha
(G)$ (proved by Short in 2016). A characterization of unicyclic non-K\"onig-Egerv\'ary graphs
is also presented and a conjecture which states that for such a graph $G$, the critical difference
equals $\alpha (G) - \mu (G)$, is proved. We also make an observation about ker$G)$ using Edmonds-Gallai
Structure Theorem as a concluding remark.
