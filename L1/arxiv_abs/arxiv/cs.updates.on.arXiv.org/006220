Sample patterns have many uses in Computer Graphics, ranging from procedural object placement
over Monte Carlo image synthesis to non-photorealistic depiction. Their properties such as discrepancy,
spectra, anisotropy, or progressiveness have been analyzed extensively. However, designing
methods to produce sampling patterns with certain properties can require substantial hand-crafting
effort, both in coding, mathematical derivation and compute time. In particular, there is no systematic
way to derive the best sampling algorithm for a specific end-task. Tackling this issue, we suggest
another level of abstraction: a toolkit to end-to-end optimize over all sampling methods to find
the one producing user-prescribed properties such as discrepancy or a spectrum that best fit the
end-task. A user simply implements the forward losses and the sampling method is found automatically
-- without coding or mathematical derivation -- by making use of back-propagation abilities of
modern deep learning frameworks. While this optimization takes long, at deployment time the sampling
method is quick to execute as iterated unstructured non-linear filtering using radial basis functions
(RBFs) to represent high-dimensional kernels. Several important previous methods are special
cases of this approach, which we compare to previous work and demonstrate its usefulness in several
typical Computer Graphics applications. Finally, we propose sampling patterns with properties
not shown before, such as high-dimensional blue noise with projective properties.
