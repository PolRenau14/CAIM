Previous research has shown that the effective use of inertial motion (i.e., less or no torque input
at the knee joint) plays an important role in achieving a smooth gait of transfemoral prostheses
in the swing phase. In our previous research, a method for generating a timed knee trajectory close
to able-bodied individuals, which leads to sufficient clearance between the foot and the floor
and the knee extension, was proposed using the inertial motion. Limb motions are known to correlate
with each other during walking. This phenomenon is called kinematic synergy. In the present study,
we measure gaits in level walking of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of walking velocities.
We show that this kinematic synergy also exists between the motions of the intact limbs and those
of the knee as determined by the inertial motion technique. We then propose a new method for generating
the motion of the knee joint using its inertial motion close to the able-bodied individuals in mid-swing
based on its kinematic synergy, such that the method can adapt to the changes in the motion velocity.
The numerical simulation results show that the proposed method achieves prosthetic walking similar
to that of able-bodied individuals with a wide range of constant walking velocities and termination
of walking from steady-state walking. Further investigations have found that a kinematic synergy
also exists at the start of walking. Overall, our method successfully achieves knee motion generation
from the initiation of walking through steady-state walking with different velocities until termination
of walking.
