Sharing location traces with context-aware service providers has privacy implications. Location-privacy
preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation, anonymization and cryptographic primitives, have
been shown to have impractical utility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user
privacy is to minimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the service
providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume shared with the untrusted entities
is significantly reduced, executing computationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained
smartphones is often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering the
computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as space-time signals. Lowering
the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the computational tasks onto the digital-signal
processors and the usage of the non-blocking signal-processing pipelines. While focusing on the
task of user mobility modeling, we achieve the following results in comparison to the state of the
art techniques: (i) mobility models with precision and recall greater than 80%, (ii) reduction
in computational complexity by a factor of 2.5, and (iii) reduction in power consumption by a factor
of 0.5. Furthermore, our technique does not rely on users' behavioral parameters that usually result
in privacy-leakage and conclusive bias in the existing techniques. Using three real-world mobility
datasets, we demonstrate that our technique addresses these weaknesses while formulating accurate
user mobility models.
