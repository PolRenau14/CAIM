In this paper, a re-evaluation undertaken for dynamic VM consolidation problem and optimal online
deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration in an experimental environment. We proceeded
to focus on energy and performance trade-off by planet lab workload traces, which consists of a thousand
Planetlab VMs with widespread simulation environments. All experiments are done in a simulated
cloud environment by the CloudSim simulation tool. A new paradigm of utility-oriented IT services
is cloud computing, which offers a pay-as-you-go model. In recent years, there has been increasing
interest among many users from business, scientific, engineering and educational territories
in cloud computing. There is increasing concern that high energy consumption issues are a disadvantage
for various institutions. However, so far too little attention has been given to the various methods
to reduce energy consumption in cloud environments while ensuring performance. Besides the evaluation
of energy-efficient data center management algorithms in the cloud, we proposed a further research
directed toward the development of energy efficient algorithms. By the experimental evaluation
of the current proposal for the competitive analysis of dynamic VM consolidation and optimal online
deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration, we found different results for different
algorithm combinations. Cloud-based data centers` consume massive energy, which has a negative
effect on the environment and operational cost, this work contributes to the energy consumption
reduction in the cloud environment.
