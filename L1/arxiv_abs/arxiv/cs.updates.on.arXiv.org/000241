Given a set of points that sample a shape, the Rips complex of the data points is often used in machine-learning
to provide an approximation of the shape easily-computed. It has been proved recently that the Rips
complex captures the homotopy type of the shape assuming the vertices of the complex meet some mild
sampling conditions. Unfortunately, the Rips complex is generally high-dimensional. To remedy
this problem, it is tempting to simplify it through a sequence of collapses. Ideally, we would like
to end up with a triangulation of the shape. Experiments suggest that, as we simplify the complex
by iteratively collapsing faces, it should indeed be possible to avoid entering a dead end such as
the famous Bing's house with two rooms. This paper provides a theoretical justification for this
empirical observation. We demonstrate that the Rips complex of a point-cloud (for a well-chosen
scale parameter) can always be turned into a simplicial complex homeomorphic to the shape by a sequence
of collapses, assuming the shape is nicely triangulable and well-sampled (two concepts we will
explain in the paper). To establish our result, we rely on a recent work which gives conditions under
which the Rips complex can be converted into a Cech complex by a sequence of collapses. We proceed
in two phases. Starting from the Cech complex, we first produce a sequence of collapses that arrives
to the Cech complex, restricted by the shape. We then apply a sequence of collapses that transforms
the result into the nerve of some robust covering of the shape.
