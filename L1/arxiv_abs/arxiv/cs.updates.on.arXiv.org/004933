Estimation techniques to precisely localize a kinematic platform with GNSS observables can be
broadly partitioned into two categories: differential, or undifferenced. The differential techniques
(e.g., real-time kinematic (RTK)) have several attractive properties, such as correlated error
mitigation and fast convergence; however, to support a differential processing scheme, an infrastructure
of reference stations within a proximity of the platform must be in place to construct observation
corrections. This infrastructure requirement makes differential processing techniques infeasible
in many locations. To mitigate the need for additional receivers within proximity of the platform,
the precise point positioning (PPP) method utilizes accurate orbit and clock models to localize
the platform. The autonomy of PPP from local reference stations make it an attractive processing
scheme for several applications; however, a current disadvantage of PPP is the slow positioning
convergence when compared to differential techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence
properties of PPP with an incremental graph optimization scheme (Incremental Smoothing and Mapping
(iSAM2)), which allows for real-time filtering and smoothing. The characterization is first conducted
through a Monte Carlo analysis within a simulation environment, which allows for the variations
of parameters, such as atmospheric conditions, satellite geometry, and intensity of multipath.
Then, an example collected data set is utilized to validate the trends presented in the simulation
study.
