Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most commonly used recommendation methods. CF consists
in predicting whether, or how much, a user will like (or dislike) an item by leveraging the knowledge
of the user's preferences as well as that of other users. In practice, users interact and express
their opinion on only a small subset of items, which makes the corresponding user-item rating matrix
very sparse. Such data sparsity yields two main problems for recommender systems: (1) the lack of
data to effectively model users' preferences, and (2) the lack of data to effectively model item
characteristics. However, there are often many other data sources that are available to a recommender
system provider, which can describe user interests and item characteristics (e.g., users' social
network, tags associated to items, etc.). These valuable data sources may supply useful information
to enhance a recommendation system in modeling users' preferences and item characteristics more
accurately and thus, hopefully, to make recommenders more precise. For various reasons, these
data sources may be managed by clusters of different data centers, thus requiring the development
of distributed solutions. In this paper, we propose a new distributed collaborative filtering
algorithm, which exploits and combines multiple and diverse data sources to improve recommendation
quality. Our experimental evaluation using real datasets shows the effectiveness of our algorithm
compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.
