Point cloud registration sits at the core of many important and challenging 3D perception problems
including autonomous navigation, SLAM, object/scene recognition, and augmented reality. In
this paper, we present a new registration algorithm that is able to achieve state-of-the-art speed
and accuracy through its use of a hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) representation. Our
method constructs a top-down multi-scale representation of point cloud data by recursively running
many small-scale data likelihood segmentations in parallel on a GPU. We leverage the resulting
representation using a novel PCA-based optimization criterion that adaptively finds the best
scale to perform data association between spatial subsets of point cloud data. Compared to previous
Iterative Closest Point and GMM-based techniques, our tree-based point association algorithm
performs data association in logarithmic-time while dynamically adjusting the level of detail
to best match the complexity and spatial distribution characteristics of local scene geometry.
In addition, unlike other GMM methods that restrict covariances to be isotropic, our new PCA-based
optimization criterion well-approximates the true MLE solution even when fully anisotropic Gaussian
covariances are used. Efficient data association, multi-scale adaptability, and a robust MLE
approximation produce an algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude both faster and more accurate
than current state-of-the-art on a wide variety of 3D datasets captured from LiDAR to structured
light.
