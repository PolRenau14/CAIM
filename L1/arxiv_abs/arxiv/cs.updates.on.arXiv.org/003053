Recommender systems, inferring users' preferences from their historical activities and personal
profiles, have been an enormous success in the last several years. Most of the existing works are
based on the similarities of users, objects or both that derived from their purchases records in
the online shopping platforms. Such approaches, however, are facing bottlenecks when the known
information is limited. The extreme case is how to recommend products to new users, namely the so-called
cold-start problem. The rise of the online social networks gives us a chance to break the glass ceiling.
Birds of a feather flock together. Close friends may have similar hidden pattern of selecting products
and the advices from friends are more trustworthy. In this paper, we integrate the individual's
social relationships into recommender systems and propose a new method, called Social Mass Diffusion
(SMD), based on a mass diffusion process in the combined network of users' social network and user-item
bipartite network. The results show that the SMD algorithm can achieve higher recommendation accuracy
than the Mass Diffusion (MD) purely on the bipartite network. Especially, the improvement is striking
for small degree users. Moreover, SMD provides a good solution to the cold-start problem. The recommendation
accuracy for new users significantly higher than that of the conventional popularity-based algorithm.
These results may shed some light on the new designs of better personalized recommender systems
and information services.
