Transfer learning using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been successfully
applied to images for different classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline for
pain expression recognition in neonates using transfer learning. Specifically, we propose to
exploit a pre-trained CNN that was originally trained on a relatively similar dataset for face recognition
(VGG Face) as well as CNNs that were pre-trained on a relatively different dataset for image classification
(iVGG F,M, and S) to extract deep features from neonates' faces. In the final stage, several supervised
machine learning classifiers are trained to classify neonates' facial expression into pain or
no pain expression. The proposed pipeline achieved, on a testing dataset, 0.841 AUC and 90.34 accuracy,
which is approx. 7 higher than the accuracy of handcrafted traditional features. We also propose
to combine deep features with traditional features and hypothesize that the mixed features would
improve pain classification performance. Combining deep features with traditional features
achieved 92.71 accuracy and 0.948 AUC. These results show that transfer learning, which is a faster
and more practical option than training CNN from the scratch, can be used to extract useful features
for pain expression recognition in neonates. It also shows that combining deep features with traditional
handcrafted features is a good practice to improve the performance of pain expression recognition
and possibly the performance of similar applications.
