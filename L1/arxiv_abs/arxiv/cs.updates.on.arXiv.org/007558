Detecting small objects over large areas remains a significant challenge in satellite imagery
analytics. Among the challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographical extent per image:
a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses over 64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Another
challenge is that objects of interest are often minuscule (~pixels in extent even for the highest
resolution imagery), which complicates traditional computer vision techniques. To address these
issues, we propose a pipeline (SIMRDWN) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrarily large size
at native resolution at a rate of > 0.2 km2/s. Building upon the tensorflow object detection API paper,
this pipeline offers a unified approach to multiple object detection frameworks that can run inference
on images of arbitrary size. The SIMRDWN pipeline includes a modified version of YOLO (known as YOLT),
along with the models of the tensorflow object detection API: SSD, Faster R-CNN, and R-FCN. The proposed
approach allows comparison of the performance of these four frameworks, and can rapidly detect
objects of vastly different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors.
For objects of very different scales (e.g. airplanes versus airports) we find that using two different
detectors at different scales is very effective with negligible runtime cost.We evaluate large
test images at native resolution and find mAP scores of 0.2 to 0.8 for vehicle localization, with
the YOLT architecture achieving both the highest mAP and fastest inference speed.
