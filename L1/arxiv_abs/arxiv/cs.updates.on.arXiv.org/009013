An unsupervised human action modeling framework can provide useful pose-sequence representation,
which can be utilized in a variety of pose analysis applications. In this work we propose a novel temporal
pose-sequence modeling framework, which can embed the dynamics of 3D human-skeleton joints to
a continuous latent space in an efficient manner. In contrast to end-to-end framework explored
by previous works, we disentangle the task of individual pose representation learning from the
task of learning actions as a trajectory in pose embedding space. In order to realize a continuous
pose embedding manifold with improved reconstructions, we propose an unsupervised, manifold
learning procedure named Encoder GAN, (or EnGAN). Further, we use the pose embeddings generated
by EnGAN to model human actions using a bidirectional RNN auto-encoder architecture, PoseRNN.
We introduce first-order gradient loss to explicitly enforce temporal regularity in the predicted
motion sequence. A hierarchical feature fusion technique is also investigated for simultaneous
modeling of local skeleton joints along with global pose variations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
transfer-ability of the learned representation against other supervisedly and unsupervisedly
learned motion embeddings for the task of fine-grained action recognition on SBU interaction dataset.
Further, we show the qualitative strengths of the proposed framework by visualizing skeleton pose
reconstructions and interpolations in pose-embedding space, and low dimensional principal component
projections of the reconstructed pose trajectories.
