As technology and communication advances, more devices (and things) are able to connect to the Internet
and talk to each other to achieve a common goal which results in the emergence of the Internet of Things
(IoT) era. It is believed that IoT will bring up a limitless number of applications and business opportunities
that will affect almost every aspect of our life. Research has already been conducted to investigate
the challenges that obstruct the realization of IoT along with the promising solutions that pave
the way for the acceptance and enabling of IoT. Among the research areas that is of a great importance
to making IoT paradigm possible is the presence of a unified programming framework that masks the
heterogeneity of the involved devices of the IoT platform. Such a framework guides system developers
throughout the IoT application development process. In this paper, we investigate the IoT concept
and its high level architecture in general and focus more on the application development aspect.
We believe that IoT applications are highly dynamic in nature and thus need to be engineered with
the self adaptive and autonomic concepts in mind. Therefore, our proposed IoT software development
lifecycle was based on the IBM architecture blueprint for autonomic systems. To cater for the runtime
dynamic and heterogeneity aspects of IoT applications, we adopt the MDD paradigm for our proposed
development framework. We highlight the core requirements of a resilient development framework
that accommodates the necessary concepts and processes for a successful IoT application.
