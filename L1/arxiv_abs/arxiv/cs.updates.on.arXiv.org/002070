Traffic speed is a key indicator for the efficiency of an urban transportation system. Accurate
modeling of the spatiotemporally varying traffic speed thus plays a crucial role in urban planning
and development. This paper addresses the problem of efficient fine-grained traffic speed prediction
using big traffic data obtained from static sensors. Gaussian processes (GPs) have been previously
used to model various traffic phenomena, including flow and speed. However, GPs do not scale with
big traffic data due to their cubic time complexity. In this work, we address their efficiency issues
by proposing local GPs to learn from and make predictions for correlated subsets of data. The main
idea is to quickly group speed variables in both spatial and temporal dimensions into a finite number
of clusters, so that future and unobserved traffic speed queries can be heuristically mapped to
one of such clusters. A local GP corresponding to that cluster can then be trained on the fly to make
predictions in real-time. We call this method localization. We use non-negative matrix factorization
for localization and propose simple heuristics for cluster mapping. We additionally leverage
on the expressiveness of GP kernel functions to model road network topology and incorporate side
information. Extensive experiments using real-world traffic data collected in the two U.S. cities
of Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., show that our proposed local GPs significantly improve both
runtime performances and prediction accuracies compared to the baseline global and local GPs.
