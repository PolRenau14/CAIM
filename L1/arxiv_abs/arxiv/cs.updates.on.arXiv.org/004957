Is it possible to extract malicious IP addresses reported in security forums in an automatic way?
This is the question at the heart of our work. We focus on security forums, where security professionals
and hackers share knowledge and information, and often report misbehaving IP addresses. So far,
there have only been a few efforts to extract information from such security forums. We propose RIPEx,
a systematic approach to identify and label IP addresses in security forums by utilizing a cross-forum
learning method. In more detail, the challenge is twofold: (a) identifying IP addresses from other
numerical entities, such as software version numbers, and (b) classifying the IP address as benign
or malicious. We propose an integrated solution that tackles both these problems. A novelty of our
approach is that it does not require training data for each new forum. Our approach does knowledge
transfer across forums: we use a classifier from our source forums to identify seed information
for training a classifier on the target forum. We evaluate our method using data collected from five
security forums with a total of 31K users and 542K posts. First, RIPEx can distinguish IP address
from other numeric expressions with 95% precision and above 93% recall on average. Second, RIPEx
identifies malicious IP addresses with an average precision of 88% and over 78% recall, using our
cross-forum learning. Our work is a first step towards harnessing the wealth of useful information
that can be found in security forums.
