Modern Code Review (MCR) plays a key role in software quality practices. In MCR process, a new patch
(i.e., a set of code changes) is encouraged to be examined by reviewers in order to identify weaknesses
in source code prior to an integration into main software repositories. To mitigate the risk of having
future defects, prior work suggests that MCR should be performed with sufficient review participation.
Indeed, recent work shows that a low number of participated reviewers is associated with poor software
quality. However, there is a likely case that a new patch still suffers from poor review participation
even though reviewers were invited. Hence, in this paper, we set out to investigate the factors that
are associated with the participation decision of an invited reviewer. Through a case study of 230,090
patches spread across the Android, LibreOffice, OpenStack and Qt systems, we find that (1) 16%-66%
of patches have at least one invited reviewer who did not respond to the review invitation; (2) human
factors play an important role in predicting whether or not an invited reviewer will participate
in a review; (3) a review participation rate of an invited reviewers and code authoring experience
of an invited reviewer are highly associated with the participation decision of an invited reviewer.
These results can help practitioners better understand about how human factors associate with
the participation decision of reviewers and serve as guidelines for inviting reviewers, leading
to a better inviting decision and a better reviewer participation.
