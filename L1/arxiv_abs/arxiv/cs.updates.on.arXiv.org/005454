We investigate the role of transferability of adversarial attacks in the observed vulnerabilities
of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We demonstrate that introducing randomness to the DNN models is
sufficient to defeat adversarial attacks, given that the adversary does not have an unlimited attack
budget. Instead of making one specific DNN model robust to perfect knowledge attacks (a.k.a, white
box attacks), creating randomness within an army of DNNs completely eliminates the possibility
of perfect knowledge acquisition, resulting in a significantly more robust DNN ensemble against
the strongest form of attacks. We also show that when the adversary has an unlimited budget of data
perturbation, all defensive techniques would eventually break down as the budget increases. Therefore,
it is important to understand the game saddle point where the adversary would not further pursue
this endeavor. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between attack severity and decision
boundary robustness in the version space. We empirically demonstrate that by simply adding a small
Gaussian random noise to the learned weights, a DNN model can increase its resilience to adversarial
attacks by as much as 74.2%. More importantly, we show that by randomly activating/revealing a model
from a pool of pre-trained DNNs at each query request, we can put a tremendous strain on the adversary's
attack strategies. We compare our randomization techniques to the Ensemble Adversarial Training
technique and show that our randomization techniques are superior under different attack budget
constraints.
