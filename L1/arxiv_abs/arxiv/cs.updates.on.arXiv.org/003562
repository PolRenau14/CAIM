Internet of things (IoT) applications have become increasingly popular in recent years, with applications
ranging from building energy monitoring to personal health tracking and activity recognition.
In order to leverage these data, automatic knowledge extraction - whereby we map from observations
to interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have seen many recent
IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert specifying states, recorded as a set of boundaries
and associated labels in a data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms
that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified boundaries as breakpoints.
Traditional changepoint detection methods only look for statistically-detectable boundaries
that are defined as abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However,
we observe that breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with
these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach, based on deep learning,
that outperforms existing techniques and learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a
high accuracy. Through extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including human-activity
sensing data, speech signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity traces - we demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm for practical applications. Furthermore, we show that our approach
achieves significantly better performance than previous methods.
