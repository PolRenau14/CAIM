Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (spMVM) is the most time-consuming kernel in many numerical
algorithms and has been studied extensively on all modern processor and accelerator architectures.
However, the optimal sparse matrix data storage format is highly hardware-specific, which could
become an obstacle when using heterogeneous systems. Also, it is as yet unclear how the wide single
instruction multiple data (SIMD) units in current multi- and many-core processors should be used
most efficiently if there is no structure in the sparsity pattern of the matrix. We suggest SELL-C-sigma,
a variant of Sliced ELLPACK, as a SIMD-friendly data format which combines long-standing ideas
from General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and vector computer programming. We discuss
the advantages of SELL-C-sigma compared to established formats like Compressed Row Storage (CRS)
and ELLPACK and show its suitability on a variety of hardware platforms (Intel Sandy Bridge, Intel
Xeon Phi and Nvidia Tesla K20) for a wide range of test matrices from different application areas.
Using appropriate performance models we develop deep insight into the data transfer properties
of the SELL-C-sigma spMVM kernel. SELL-C-sigma comes with two tuning parameters whose performance
impact across the range of test matrices is studied and for which reasonable choices are proposed.
This leads to a hardware-independent ("catch-all") sparse matrix format, which achieves very
high efficiency for all test matrices across all hardware platforms.
