Chemotherapeutic response of cancer cells to a given compound is one of the most fundamental information
one requires to design anti-cancer drugs. Recent advances in producing large drug screens against
cancer cell lines provided an opportunity to apply machine learning methods for this purpose. In
addition to cytotoxicity databases, considerable amount of drug-induced gene expression data
has also become publicly available. Following this, several methods that exploit omics data were
proposed to predict drug activity on cancer cells. However, due to the complexity of cancer drug
mechanisms, none of the existing methods are perfect. One possible direction, therefore, is to
combine the strengths of both the methods and the databases for improved performance. We demonstrate
that integrating a large number of predictions by the proposed method improves the performance
for this task. The predictors in the ensemble differ in several aspects such as the method itself,
the number of tasks method considers (multi-task vs. single-task) and the subset of data considered
(sub-sampling). We show that all these different aspects contribute to the success of the final
ensemble. In addition, we attempt to use the drug screen data together with two novel signatures
produced from the drug-induced gene expression profiles of cancer cell lines. Finally, we evaluate
the method predictions by in vitro experiments in addition to the tests on data sets.The predictions
