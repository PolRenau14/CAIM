The shortage of training samples remains one of the main obstacles in applying the artificial neural
networks (ANN) to the hyperspectral images classification. To fuse the spatial and spectral information,
pixel patches are often utilized to train a model, which may further aggregate this problem. In the
existing works, an ANN model supervised by center-loss (ANNC) was introduced. Training merely
with spectral information, the ANNC yields discriminative spectral features suitable for the
subsequent classification tasks. In this paper, a CNN-based spatial feature fusion (CSFF) algorithm
is proposed, which allows a smart fusion of the spatial information to the spectral features extracted
by ANNC. As a critical part of CSFF, a CNN-based discriminant model is introduced to estimate whether
two paring pixels belong to the same class. At the testing stage, by applying the discriminant model
to the pixel-pairs generated by the test pixel and its neighbors, the local structure is estimated
and represented as a customized convolutional kernel. The spectral-spatial feature is obtained
by a convolutional operation between the estimated kernel and the corresponding spectral features
within a neighborhood. At last, the label of the test pixel is predicted by classifying the resulting
spectral-spatial feature. Without increasing the number of training samples or involving pixel
patches at the training stage, the CSFF framework achieves the state-of-the-art by declining $20\%-50\%$
classification failures in experiments on three well-known hyperspectral images.
