While the existence of low-dimensional embedding manifolds has been shown in patterns of collective
motion, the current battery of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are not amenable to
the analysis of such manifolds. This is mainly due to the necessary spectral decomposition step,
which limits control over the mapping from the original high-dimensional space to the embedding
space. Here, we propose an alternative approach that demands a two-dimensional embedding which
topologically summarizes the high-dimensional data. In this sense, our approach is closely related
to the construction of one-dimensional principal curves that minimize orthogonal error to data
points subject to smoothness constraints. Specifically, we construct a two-dimensional principal
manifold directly in the high-dimensional space using cubic smoothing splines, and define the
embedding coordinates in terms of geodesic distances. Thus, the mapping from the high-dimensional
data to the manifold is defined in terms of local coordinates. Through representative examples,
we show that compared to existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, the principal manifold
retains the original structure even in noisy and sparse datasets. The principal manifold finding
algorithm is applied to configurations obtained from a dynamical system of multiple agents simulating
a complex maneuver called predator mobbing, and the resulting two-dimensional embedding is compared
with that of a well-established nonlinear dimensionality reduction method.
