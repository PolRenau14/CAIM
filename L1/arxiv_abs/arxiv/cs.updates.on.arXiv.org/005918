The affect embedded in video data conveys high-level semantic information about the content and
has direct impact on the understanding and perception of reviewers, as well as their emotional responses.
Affective Video Content Analysis (AVCA) attempts to generate a direct mapping between video content
and the corresponding affective states such as arousal and valence dimensions. Most existing studies
establish the mapping for each dimension separately using knowledge-based rules or traditional
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). The inherent correlations between affective
dimensions have largely been unexploited, which are anticipated to include important information
for accurate prediction of affective dimensions. To address this issue, this paper presents an
approach to predict arousal and valance dimensions synchronously using the Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network. The approach extracts a set of low-level audio and visual features from video data
and projects them synchronously into pairs of arousal and valence values using the LSTM network
which automatically incorporates the correlations between arousal and valance dimensions. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a dataset comprising video clips segmented
from real-world resources such as film, drama, and news, and demonstrate its superior performance
over the traditional SVM based method. The results provide one of the earliest preliminary evidence
to the benefit of considering correlations between affective dimensions towards accurate AVCA.
