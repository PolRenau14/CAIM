IoT devices and sensors have been utilized in a cooperative manner to enable the concept of a smart
environment. In these smart settings, abundant data is generated as a result of the interactions
between devices and users' day-to-day activities. Such data contain valuable forensic information
about events and actions occurring inside the smart environment and, if analyzed, may help hold
those violating security policies accountable. In this paper, we introduce IoTDots, a novel digital
forensic framework for a smart environment such as smart homes and smart offices. IoTDots has two
main components: IoTDots-Modifier and IoTDots-Analyzer. At compile time, IoTDots-Modifier
performs the source code analysis of smart apps, detects forensically-relevant information,
and automatically insert tracing logs. Then, at runtime, the logs are stored into a IoTDots database.
Later, in the event of a forensic investigation, the IoTDots-Analyzer applies data processing
and machine learning techniques to extract valuable and usable forensic information from the devices'
activity. In order to test the performance of IoTDots, we tested IoTDots in a realistic smart office
environment with a total of 22 devices and sensors. The evaluation results show that IoTDots can
achieve, on average, over 98% of accuracy on detecting user activities and over 96% accuracy on detecting
the behavior of users, devices, and apps in a smart environment. Finally, IoTDots performance yields
no overhead to the smart devices and very minimal overhead to the cloud server.
