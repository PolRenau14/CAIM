Convex hulls are a fundamental geometric tool used in a number of algorithms. A famous paper by Akl
and Toussaint in 1978 described a way to reduce the number of points involved in the computation,
which is since known as the Akl-Toussaint heuristics. This paper first studies what this heurstics
really represents in terms of reduction of points and demonstrates that the optimum selection is
reached using an octogon as the remaining number of points is in O(sqrt(N)) rather than the usual
O(N). Then it focuses on optimising the overall computational efficiency in a convex hull computation.
Although the heuristics is usually used as a first step in computations one can obtain the convex
hull directly from the heuristics's basis. First a simple incremental implementation is described,
and if the number of characteristic points of the Akl-Toussaint heuristics p is taken as a parametre
the convex hull is then computed in a O(N(p+h/p)) average complexity or O(Nh) asymptotic complexity.
Given the relative constant factor of 1/p however experimental results show that this algorithm
should be considered linear in average. Worst-case complexity is in O(N^2) and space complexity
is O(h) but could be O(1) if the required output is the array of convex vertices's indexes. Then a remark
on why the basic incremental method should be preferred for average cases is made. Finally an optimal
linear algorithm both in average and worst-case and using a minimal space complexity in O(sqrt(N))
in average (or O(1) if in-place computation is allowed) is presented.
