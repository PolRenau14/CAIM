Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a powerful and established technique for assessing the quality
of photovoltaic (PV) modules, which consist of many electrically connected solar cells arranged
in a grid. The analysis of imperfect real-world images requires reliable methods for preprocessing,
detection and extraction of the cells. We propose several methods for those tasks, which, however,
can be modified to related imaging problems where similar geometric objects need to be detected
accurately. Allowing for images taken under difficult outdoor conditions, we present methods
to correct for rotation and perspective distortions. The next important step is the extraction
of the solar cells of a PV module, for instance to pass them to a procedure to detect and analyze defects
on their surface. We propose a method based on specialized Hough transforms, which allows to extract
the cells even when the module is surrounded by disturbing background and a fast method based on cumulated
sums (CUSUM) change detection to extract the cell area of single-cell mini-module, where the correction
of perspective distortion is implicitly done. The methods are highly automatized to allow for big
data analyses. Their application to a large database of EL images substantiates that the methods
work reliably on a large scale for real-world images. Simulations show that the approach achieves
high accuracy, reliability and robustness. This even holds for low contrast images as evaluated
by comparing the simulated accuracy for a low and a high contrast image.
