We consider the problem of estimating a signal from noisy circularly-translated versions of itself,
called multireference alignment (MRA). One natural approach to MRA could be to estimate the shifts
of the observations first, and infer the signal by aligning and averaging the data. In contrast,
we consider a method based on estimating the signal directly, using features of the signal that are
invariant under translations. Specifically, we estimate the power spectrum and the bispectrum
of the signal from the observations. Under mild assumptions, these invariant features contain
enough information to infer the signal. In particular, the bispectrum can be used to estimate the
Fourier phases. To this end, we propose and analyze a few algorithms. Our main methods consist of
non-convex optimization over the smooth manifold of phases. Empirically, in the absence of noise,
these non-convex algorithms appear to converge to the target signal with random initialization.
The algorithms are also robust to noise. We then suggest three additional methods. These methods
are based on frequency marching, semidefinite relaxation and integer programming. The first two
methods provably recover the phases exactly in the absence of noise. In the high noise level regime,
the invariant features approach for MRA results in stable estimation if the number of measurements
scales like the cube of the noise variance, which is the information-theoretic rate. Additionally,
it requires only one pass over the data which is important at low signal-to-noise ratio when the number
of observations must be large.
