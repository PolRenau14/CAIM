As mobile IP-access is becoming the dominant technology for providing wireless services, the demand
for more spectrum for this type of access is increasing rapidly. Since IP-access can be used for all
types of services, instead of a plethora of dedicated, single-service systems, there is a significant
potential to make spectrum use more efficient. In this paper, the feasibility and potential benefit
of replacing the current terrestrial UHF TV broadcasting system with a mobile, cellular data (IP-)
network is analyzed. In the cellular network, TV content would be provided as {one} of the services,
here referred to as CellTV. In the investigation we consider typical Swedish rural and urban environments.
We use different models for TV viewing patterns and cellular technologies as expected in the year
2020. Results of the quantitative analysis indicate that CellTV distribution can be beneficial
if the TV consumption trend goes towards more specialized programming, more local contents, and
more on-demand requests. Mobile cellular systems, with their flexible unicast capabilities,
will be an ideal platform to provide these services. However, the results also demonstrate that
CellTV is not a spectrum-efficient replacement for terrestrial TV broadcasting with current viewing
patterns (i.e. a moderate number of channels with each a high numbers of viewers). In this case, it
is doubtful whether the expected spectrum savings can motivate the necessary investments in upgrading
cellular sites and developing advanced TV receiver required for the success of CellTV distribution.
