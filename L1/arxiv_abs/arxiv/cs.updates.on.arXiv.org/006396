In this work, we propose bag of adversarial features (BAF) for identifying mild traumatic brain
injury (MTBI) patients from their diffusion magnetic resonance images (MRI) (obtained within
one month of injury) by incorporating unsupervised feature learning techniques. MTBI is a growing
public health problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in US. Diagnosis
is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete measures of injury are lacking.
Unlike most of previous works, which use hand-crafted features extracted from different parts
of brain for MTBI classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more discriminative
representation for this task. A major challenge in this field thus far is the relatively small number
of subjects available for training. This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional
neural network to directly classify a subject from MR images. To overcome this challenge, we first
apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn patch-level features,
from overlapping image patches extracted from different brain regions. We then aggregate these
features through a bag-of-word approach. We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset
of 227 subjects (including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex matched healthy controls), and
compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches. Our experimental results
show that the BAF significantly outperforms earlier works relying on the mean values of MR metrics
in selected brain regions.
