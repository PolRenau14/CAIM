Noisy channels are a powerful resource for cryptography as they can be used to obtain information-theoretically
secure key agreement, commitment and oblivious transfer protocols, among others. Oblivious transfer
(OT) is a fundamental primitive since it is complete for secure multi-party computation, and the
OT capacity characterizes how efficiently a channel can be used for obtaining string oblivious
transfer. Ahlswede and Csisz\'{a}r (\emph{ISIT'07}) presented upper and lower bounds on the OT
capacity of generalized erasure channels (GEC) against passive adversaries. In the case of GEC
with erasure probability at least 1/2, the upper and lower bounds match and therefore the OT capacity
was determined. It was later proved by Pinto et al. (\emph{IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 57(8)}) that in
this case there is also a protocol against malicious adversaries achieving the same lower bound,
and hence the OT capacity is identical for passive and malicious adversaries. In the case of GEC with
erasure probability smaller than 1/2, the known lower bound against passive adversaries that was
established by Ahlswede and Csisz\'{a}r does not match their upper bound and it was unknown whether
this OT rate could be achieved against malicious adversaries as well. In this work we show that there
is a protocol against malicious adversaries achieving the same OT rate that was obtained against
passive adversaries. In order to obtain our results we introduce a novel use of interactive hashing
that is suitable for dealing with the case of low erasure probability ($p^* <1/2$).
