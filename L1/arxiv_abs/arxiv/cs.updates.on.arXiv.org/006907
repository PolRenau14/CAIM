Sensemaking is the cognitive process of extracting information, creating schemata from knowledge,
making decisions from those schemata, and inferring conclusions. Human analysts are essential
to exploring and quantifying this process, but they are limited by their inability to process the
volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data. Visualization tools are essential for helping
this human-computer interaction. For example, analytical tools that use graphical linknode visualization
can help sift through vast amounts of information. However, assisting the analyst in making connections
with visual tools can be challenging if the information is not presented in an intuitive manner.
Experimentally, it has been shown that analysts increase the number of hypotheses formed if they
use visual analytic capabilities. Exploring multiple perspectives could increase the diversity
of those hypotheses, potentially minimizing cognitive biases. In this paper, we discuss preliminary
research results that indicate an improvement in sensemaking over the traditional link-node visualization
tools by incorporating an annotation enhancement that differentiates links connecting nodes.
This enhancement assists by providing a visual cue, which represents the perceived value of reported
information. We conclude that this improved sensemaking occurs because of the removal of the limitations
of mentally consolidating, weighing, and highlighting data. This study aims to investigate whether
line thickness can be used as a valid representation of VoI.
