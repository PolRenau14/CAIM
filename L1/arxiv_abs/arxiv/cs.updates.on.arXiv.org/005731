Balance is the fundamental skill behind human locomotion, and its impairment is the principal indicator
of self-perceived disability. Despite significant improvements in balance assessment, there
is still large incidence of fall related injuries among elderlies. The Base of Support (BoS) is a
popular method for bipedal stability assessment, but its accuracy depends on the accuracy the BoS
geometry measurement. This work presents a method to ease the BoS tracking by the identification
of a reference frame that allows to define postural models of the BoS geometry. Although we also propose
a geometry based on the geometry determined from centre of pressure range of motion within the foot
obtained from literature, this methodology can be used with other models (i.e., the feasible base
of support). The model has been tested with 12 healthy subjects, which have been asked to explore
their stability in six different postures. The results show that the model can accurate deform the
geometry of the BoS to adapt its shape to the different postures, which is can remove the necessity
of force/torque sensors in some application. Potentially the proposed method can be also applied
to describe any posture dependent attribute (e.g., gravitational forces), and it can be also applied
to bipedal robots. Therefore, it constitutes a novel mathematical tool that can be deployed to develop
both better sensors and models for bipeds. For example, it can be used with the Extrapolated CoM model
to evaluate dynamic stability from the body kinematics.
