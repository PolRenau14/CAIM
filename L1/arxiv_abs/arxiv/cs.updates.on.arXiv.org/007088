In a variety of fields, in particular those involving imaging and optics, we often measure signals
whose phase is missing or has been irremediably distorted. Phase retrieval attempts to recover
the phase information of a signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform to enable the reconstruction
of the original signal. Solving the phase retrieval problem is equivalent to recovering a signal
from its auto-correlation function. In this paper, we assume the original signal to be sparse; this
is a natural assumption in many applications, such as X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging and
blind channel estimation. We propose an algorithm that resolves the phase retrieval problem in
three stages: i) we leverage the finite rate of innovation sampling theory to super-resolve the
auto-correlation function from a limited number of samples, ii) we design a greedy algorithm that
identifies the locations of a sparse solution given the super-resolved auto-correlation function,
iii) we recover the amplitudes of the atoms given their locations and the measured auto-correlation
function. Unlike traditional approaches that recover a discrete approximation of the underlying
signal, our algorithm estimates the signal on a continuous domain, which makes it the first of its
kind. Along with the algorithm, we derive its performance bound with a theoretical analysis and
propose a set of enhancements to improve its computational complexity and noise resilience. Finally,
we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method via a comparison against Charge Flipping, a notable
algorithm in crystallography.
