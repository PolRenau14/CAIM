The contextual information (i.e., the time and location) in which a photo is taken can be easily tampered
with or falsely claimed by forgers to achieve malicious purposes, e.g., creating fear among the
general public. A rich body of work has focused on detecting photo tampering and manipulation by
verifying the integrity of image content. Instead, we aim to detect photo misuse by verifying the
capture time and location of photos. This paper is motivated by the law of nature that sun position
varies with the time and location, which can be used to determine whether the claimed contextual
information corresponds with the sun position that the image content actually indicates. Prior
approaches to inferring sun position from images mainly rely on vanishing points associated with
at least two shadows, while we propose novel algorithms which utilize only one shadow in the image
to infer the sun position. Meanwhile, we compute the sun position by applying astronomical algorithms
which take as input the claimed capture time and location. Only when the two estimated sun positions
are consistent can the claimed contextual information be genuine. We have developed a prototype
called IMAGEGUARD. The experimental results show that our method can successfully estimate sun
position and detect the time-location inconsistency with high accuracy. By setting the thresholds
to be 9.4 degrees and 5 degrees for the sun position distance and the altitude angle distance, respectively,
our system can correctly identify 91.5% of falsified photos with fake contextual information.
