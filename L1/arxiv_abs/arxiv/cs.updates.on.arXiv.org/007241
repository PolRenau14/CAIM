We present a deep learning model, DE-LSTM, for the simulation of a stochastic process with an underlying
nonlinear dynamics. The deep learning model aims to approximate the probability density function
of a stochastic process via numerical discretization and the underlying nonlinear dynamics is
modeled by the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. It is shown that, when the numerical discretization
is used, the function estimation problem can be solved by a multi-label classification problem.
A penalized maximum log likelihood method is proposed to impose a smoothness condition in the prediction
of the probability distribution. We show that the time evolution of the probability distribution
can be computed by a high-dimensional integration of the transition probability of the LSTM internal
states. A Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the high-dimensional integration is outlined.
The behavior of DE-LSTM is thoroughly investigated by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and
noisy observations of nonlinear dynamical systems; Mackey-Glass time series and forced Van der
Pol oscillator. It is shown that DE-LSTM makes a good prediction of the probability distribution
without assuming any distributional properties of the stochastic process. For a multiple-step
forecast of the Mackey-Glass time series, the prediction uncertainty, denoted by the 95\% confidence
interval, first grows, then dynamically adjusts following the evolution of the system, while in
the simulation of the forced Van der Pol oscillator, the prediction uncertainty does not grow in
time even for a 3,000-step forecast.
