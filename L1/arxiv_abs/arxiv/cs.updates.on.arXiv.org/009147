Big data analytics is one of the state-of-the-art tools to optimize networks and transform them
from merely being a blind tube that conveys data, into a cognitive, conscious, and self-optimizing
entity that can intelligently adapt according to the needs of its users. This, in fact, can be regarded
as one of the highest forthcoming priorities of future networks. In this paper, we propose a system
for Out-Patient (OP) centric Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) network optimization. Big
data harvested from the OPs' medical records, along with current readings from their body sensors
are processed and analyzed to predict the likelihood of a life-threatening medical condition,
for instance, an imminent stroke. This prediction is used to ensure that the OP is assigned an optimal
LTE-A Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to transmit their critical data to their healthcare provider
with minimal delay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time big data analytics are utilized
to optimize a cellular network in an OP-conscious manner. The PRBs assignment is optimized using
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a real-time heuristic. Two approaches are proposed,
the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization (WSRMax) approach and the Proportional Fairness (PF) approach.
The approaches increased the OPs' average SINR by 26.6% and 40.5%, respectively. The WSRMax approach
increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, however, the PF approach
reported higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.
