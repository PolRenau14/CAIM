This work tackles the face recognition task on images captured using thermal camera sensors which
can operate in the non-light environment. While it can greatly increase the scope and benefits of
the current security surveillance systems, performing such a task using thermal images is a challenging
problem compared to face recognition task in the Visible Light Domain (VLD). This is partly due to
the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected compared to the VLD data. Unfortunately,
direct application of the existing very strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into
the thermal imagery data will not produce a satisfactory performance. This is due to the existence
of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we propose a Thermal-to-Visible
Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is able to transform thermal face images into their
corresponding VLD images whilst maintaining identity information which is sufficient enough
for the existing VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are presented
in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an explicit closed-set face recognition
loss to regularize the discriminator network training. This information will then be conveyed
into the generator network in the forms of gradient loss. In the experiment, we show that by using
this additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the TV-GAN is able to preserve
more identity information when translating a thermal image of a person which is not seen before by
the TV-GAN.
