The quality of mathematics education depends largely on the quality of education in general. The
main idea may be summarized as follows: in order to educate the younger generation of people to be
able to meet adequately the demands of the time, it is necessary to create conditions for the high-quality
mathematics education. Improving the quality of mathematics education of pupils in secondary
school is one of the most pressing problems. Contents of the school course of mathematics and its
teaching method has always been the subject of undammed and sometimes stormy scientific debates.
There are especially true methods of teaching algebra and the analisis in the high secondary school.
Still in the study process the algebraic concepts and principles of analysis are given in such an
abstract and generalized form that the student may has considerable difficulties to map these general
abstract concepts to the certain concrete images, they are generalizations of. Improving education
quality indicators can be achieved by using the appropriate computer technology. The article deals
with the use of the cloud-oriented systems of computer mathematics (SCM). The prospects of development
of the Web-SCM in terms of cloud-based learning environment are considered. The pedagogical features
of the SageMath Cloud use as a tool for mathematics learning are revealed. The methodological aspects
of algebra and elementary analysis teaching in a high profile school using the cloud-oriented the
SCM SageMath Cloud are revealed.
