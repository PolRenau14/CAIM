To obtain effective pedestrian detection results in surveillance video, there have been many methods
proposed to handle the problems from severe occlusion, pose variation, clutter background, \emph{etc}.
Besides detection accuracy, a robust surveillance video system should be stable to video quality
degradation by network transmission, environment variation, etc. In this study, we conduct the
research on the robustness of pedestrian detection algorithms to video quality degradation. The
main contribution of this work includes the following three aspects. First, a large-scale Distorted
Surveillance Video Data Set (DSurVD) is constructed from high-quality video sequences and their
corresponding distorted versions. Second, we design a method to evaluate detection stability
and a robustness measure called Robustness Quadrangle, which can be adopted to visualize detection
accuracy of pedestrian detection algorithms on high-quality video sequences and stability with
video quality degradation. Third, the robustness of seven existing pedestrian detection algorithms
is evaluated by the built DSurVD. Experimental results show that the robustness can be further improved
for existing pedestrian detection algorithms. Additionally, we provide much in-depth discussion
on how different distortion types influence the performance of pedestrian detection algorithms,
which is important to design effective pedestrian detection algorithms for surveillance. The
DSurVD data set can be download from BaiduYunDisk, https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I9Kqj8rmubOYu7bkBfkUpA,
