In Chung-Lu random graphs, a classic model for real-world networks, each vertex is equipped with
a weight drawn from a power-law distribution, and two vertices form an edge independently with probability
proportional to the product of their weights. Chung-Lu graphs have average distance O(log log n)
and thus reproduce the small-world phenomenon, a key property of real-world networks. Modern,
more realistic variants of this model also equip each vertex with a random position in a specific
underlying geometry. The edge probability of two vertices then depends, say, inversely polynomial
on their distance. In this paper we study a generic augmented version of Chung-Lu random graphs.
We analyze a model where the edge probability of two vertices can depend arbitrarily on their positions,
as long as the marginal probability of forming an edge (for two vertices with fixed weights, one fixed
position, and one random position) is as in Chung-Lu random graphs. The resulting class contains
Chung-Lu random graphs, hyperbolic random graphs, and geometric inhomogeneous random graphs
as special cases. Our main result is that every random graph model in this general class has the same
average distance as Chung-Lu random graphs, up to a factor 1+o(1). This shows in particular that
specific choices, such as the underlying geometry being Euclidean or the dependence on the distance
being inversely polynomial, do not significantly influence the average distance. The proof also
yields that our model has a giant component and polylogarithmic diameter with high probability.
