We consider models of growing multi-level systems wherein the growth process is driven by rules
of tournament selection. A system can be conceived as an evolving tree with a new node being attached
to a contestant node at the best hierarchy level (a level nearest to the tree root). The proposed evolution
reflects limited information on system properties available to new nodes. It can also be expressed
in terms of population dynamics. Two models are considered: a constant tournament (CT) model wherein
the number of tournament participants is constant throughout system evolution, and a proportional
tournament (PT) model where this number increases proportionally to the growing size of the system
itself. The results of analytical calculations based on a rate equation fit well to numerical simulations
for both models. In the CT model all hierarchy levels emerge but the birth time of a consecutive hierarchy
level increases exponentially or faster for each new level. The number of nodes at the first hierarchy
level grows logarithmically in time, while the size of the last, "worst" hierarchy level oscillates
quasi log-periodically. In the PT model the occupations of the first two hierarchy levels increase
linearly but worse hierarchy levels either do not emerge at all or appear only by chance in early stage
of system evolution to further stop growing at all. The results allow to conclude that information
available to each new node in tournament dynamics restrains the emergence of new hierarchy levels
and that it is the absolute amount of information, not relative, which governs such behavior.
