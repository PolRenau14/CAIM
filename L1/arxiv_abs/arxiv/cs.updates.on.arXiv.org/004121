Objective: This work aims at providing a new method for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation,
other arrhythmia and noise on short single lead ECG signals, emphasizing the importance of the interpretability
of the classification results. Approach: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac
behavior is obtained by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the \textit{Construe}
abductive framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are extracted for each individual heartbeat
and as a summary of the full record. The feature distributions were used to elucidate the expert criteria
underlying the labeling of the 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge dataset, enabling a manual partial
relabeling to improve the consistency of the classification rules. Finally, state-of-the-art
machine learning methods are combined to provide an answer on the basis of the feature values. Main
results: The proposal tied for the first place in the official stage of the Challenge, with a combined
$F_1$ score of 0.83, and was even improved in the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant simplification
of the model. Significance: This approach demonstrates the potential of \textit{Construe} to
provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data even with significant amounts of noise
and artifacts. Also, we discuss the importance of a consistent classification criteria in manually
labeled training datasets, and the fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize
and validate that criteria.
