Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) techniques for lung field segmentation from chest radiographs
(CXR) have been proposed for adult cohorts, but rarely for pediatric subjects. Statistical shape
models (SSMs), the workhorse of most state-of-the-art CXR-based lung field segmentation methods,
do not efficiently accommodate shape variation of the lung field during the pediatric developmental
stages. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a generic lung field segmentation framework
from CXR accommodating large shape variation for adult and pediatric cohorts; (2) a deep representation
learning detection mechanism, \emph{ensemble space learning}, for robust object localization;
and (3) \emph{marginal shape deep learning} for the shape deformation parameter estimation. Unlike
the iterative approach of conventional SSMs, the proposed shape learning mechanism transforms
the parameter space into marginal subspaces that are solvable efficiently using the recursive
representation learning mechanism. Furthermore, our method is the first to include the challenging
retro-cardiac region in the CXR-based lung segmentation for accurate lung capacity estimation.
The framework is evaluated on 668 CXRs of patients between 3 month to 89 year of age. We obtain a mean
Dice similarity coefficient of $0.96\pm0.03$ (including the retro-cardiac region). For a given
accuracy, the proposed approach is also found to be faster than conventional SSM-based iterative
segmentation methods. The computational simplicity of the proposed generic framework could be
similarly applied to the fast segmentation of other deformable objects.
