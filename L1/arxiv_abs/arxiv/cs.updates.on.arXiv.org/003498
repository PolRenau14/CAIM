We are witnessing an enormous growth in the volume of data generated by various online services.
An important portion of this data contains geographic references, since many of these services
are \emph{location-enhanced} and thus produce spatio-temporal records of their usage. We postulate
that the spatio-temporal usage records belonging to the same real-world entity can be matched across
records from different location-enhanced services. Linking spatio-temporal records enables
data analysts and service providers to obtain information that they cannot derive by analyzing
only one set of usage records. In this paper, we develop a new \emph{linkage model} that can be used
to match entities from two sets of spatio-temporal usage records belonging to two different location-enhanced
services. This linkage model is based on the concept of $k$-$l$ \emph{diversity} --- that we developed
to capture both spatial and temporal aspects of the linkage. To realize this linkage model in practice,
we develop a scalable linking algorithm called \emph{ST-Link}, which makes use of effective spatial
and temporal filtering mechanisms that significantly reduce the search space for matching users.
Furthermore, \emph{ST-Link} utilizes sequential scan procedures to avoid random disk access
and thus scales to large datasets. We evaluated our work with respect to accuracy and performance
using several datasets. Experiments show that \emph{ST-Link} is effective in practice for performing
spatio-temporal linkage and can scale to large datasets.
