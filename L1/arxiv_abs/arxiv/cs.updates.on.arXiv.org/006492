Recent fast style transfer methods use a pre-trained convolutional neural network as a feature
encoder and a perceptual loss network. Although the pre-trained network is used to generate responses
of receptive fields effective for representing style and content of image, it is not optimized for
image style transfer but rather for image classification. Furthermore, it also requires a time-consuming
and correlation-considering feature alignment process for image style transfer because of its
inter-channel correlation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning method which optimizes
an encoder/decoder network for the purpose of style transfer as well as relieves the feature alignment
complexity from considering inter-channel correlation. We used uncorrelation loss, i.e., the
total correlation coefficient between the responses of different encoder channels, with style
and content losses for training style transfer network. This makes the encoder network to be trained
to generate inter-channel uncorrelated features and to be optimized for the task of image style
transfer which maintained the quality of image style only with a light-weighted and correlation-unaware
feature alignment process. Moreover, our method drastically reduced redundant channels of the
encoded feature and this resulted in the efficient size of structure of network and faster forward
processing speed. Our method can also be applied to cascade network scheme for multiple scaled style
transferring and allows user-control of style strength by using a content-style trade-off parameter.
