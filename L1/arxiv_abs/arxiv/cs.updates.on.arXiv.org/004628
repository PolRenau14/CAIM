The view and the view update are known mechanism for controlling access of data and for integrating
data of different schemas. Despite intensive and long research on them in both the database community
and the programming language community, we are facing difficulties to use them in practice. The
main reason is that we are lacking of control over the view update strategy to deal with inherited
ambiguity of view update for a given view. This vision paper aims to provide a new language-based
approach to controlling and integrating decentralized data based on the view, and establish a software
foundation for systematic construction of such data management systems. Our key observation is
that a view should be defined through a view update strategy rather than a query. In other words, the
view definition should be extracted from the view update strategy, which is in sharp contrast to
the traditional approaches where the view update strategy is derived from the view definition.
In this paper, we present the first programmable architecture with a declarative language for specifying
update strategies over views, whose unique view definition can be automatically derived, and show
how it can be effectively used to control data access, integrate data generally allowing coexistence
of GAV (global as view) and LAV (local as view), and perform both analysis and updates on the integrated
data. We demonstrate its usefulness through development of a privacy-preserving ride-sharing
alliance system, discuss its application scope, and highlight future challenges.
