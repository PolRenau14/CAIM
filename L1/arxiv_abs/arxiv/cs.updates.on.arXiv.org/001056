Nowadays, a computing cluster in a typical data center can easily consist of hundreds of thousands
of commodity servers, making component/ machine failures the norm rather than exception. A parallel
processing job can be delayed substantially as long as one of its many tasks is being assigned to a
failing machine. To tackle this so-called straggler problem, most parallel processing frameworks
such as MapReduce have adopted various strategies under which the system may speculatively launch
additional copies of the same task if its progress is abnormally slow or simply because extra idling
resource is available. In this paper, we focus on the design of speculative execution schemes for
a parallel processing cluster under different loading conditions. For the lightly loaded case,
we analyze and propose two optimization-based schemes, namely, the Smart Cloning Algorithm (SCA)
which is based on maximizing the job utility and the Straggler Detection Algorithm (SDA) which minimizes
the overall resource consumption of a job. We also derive the workload threshold under which SCA
or SDA should be used for speculative execution. Our simulation results show both SCA and SDA can
reduce the job flowtime by nearly 60% comparing to the speculative execution strategy of Microsoft
Mantri. For the heavily loaded case, we propose the Enhanced Speculative Execution (ESE) algorithm
which is an extension of the Microsoft Mantri scheme. We show that the ESE algorithm can beat the Mantri
baseline scheme by 18% in terms of job flowtime while consuming the same amount of resource.
