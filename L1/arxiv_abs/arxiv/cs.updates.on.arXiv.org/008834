The prediction of high-resolution hourly traffic volumes of a given roadway is essential for transportation
planning. Traditionally, Automatic Traffic Recorders (ATR) are used to collect this hourly volume
data. These large datasets are time series data characterized by long-term temporal dependencies
and missing values. Regarding the temporal dependencies, all roadways are characterized by seasonal
variations that can be weekly, monthly or yearly, depending on the cause of the variation. Regarding
the missing data in a time-series sequence, traditional time series forecasting models perform
poorly under the influence of seasonal variations. To address this limitation, robust, Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) based, multi-step ahead forecasting models are developed for time-series
in this study. The simple RNN, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
units are used to develop the model and evaluate its performance. Two approaches are used to address
the missing value issue: masking and imputation, in conjunction with the RNN models. Six different
imputation algorithms are then used to identify the best model. The analysis indicates that the
LSTM model performs better than simple RNN and GRU models, and imputation performs better than masking
to predict future traffic volume. Based on analysis using 92 ATRs, the LSTM-Median model is deemed
the best model in all scenarios for hourly traffic volume and AADT prediction, with an average RMSE
of 274 and MAPE of 18.91% for hourly traffic volume prediction and average RMSE of 824 and MAPE of 2.10%
for AADT prediction.
