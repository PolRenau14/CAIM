Muscle coordination patterns of lingual behaviors are synergies generated by deforming local
muscle groups in a variety of ways. Functional units are functional muscle groups of local structural
elements within the tongue that compress, expand, and move in a cohesive and consistent manner.
Identifying the functional units using tagged-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sheds light on
the mechanisms of normal and pathological muscle coordination patterns, yielding improvement
in surgical planning, treatment, or rehabilitation procedures. Here, to mine this information,
we propose a matrix factorization and probabilistic graphical model framework to produce building
blocks and their associated weighting map using motion quantities extracted from tagged-MRI.
Our tagged-MRI imaging and 4D (3D space with time) voxel-level tracking provide previously unavailable
internal tongue motion patterns, thus revealing the inner workings of the tongue during speech
or other lingual behaviors. We then employ spectral clustering on the weighting map to identify
the cohesive regions defined by the tongue motion that may involve multiple or undocumented regions.
To evaluate our method, we perform a series of experiments. We first use two-dimensional image and
synthetic data to demonstrate the accuracy of our method. We then use three-dimensional synthetic
and in vivo tongue motion data using protrusion and simple speech tasks to identify subject-specific
and data-driven functional units of the tongue in localized regions.
