The ability to recognize the liquid surface and the liquid level in transparent containers is perhaps
the most commonly used evaluation method when dealing with fluids. Such recognition is essential
in determining the liquid volume, fill level, phase boundaries and phase separation in various
fluid systems. The recognition of liquid surfaces is particularly important in solution chemistry,
where it is essential to many laboratory techniques (e.g., extraction, distillation, titration).
A general method for the recognition of interfaces between liquid and air or between phase-separating
liquids could have a wide range of applications and contribute to the understanding of the visual
properties of such interfaces. This work examines a computer vision method for the recognition
of liquid surfaces and liquid levels in various transparent containers. The method can be applied
to recognition of both liquid-air and liquid-liquid surfaces. No prior knowledge of the number
of phases is required. The method receives the image of the liquid container and the boundaries of
the container in the image and scans all possible curves that could correspond to the outlines of
liquid surfaces in the image. The method then compares each curve to the image to rate its correspondence
with the outline of the real liquid surface by examining various image properties in the area surrounding
each point of the curve. The image properties that were found to give the best indication of the liquid
surface are the relative intensity change, the edge density change and the gradient direction relative
to the curve normal.
