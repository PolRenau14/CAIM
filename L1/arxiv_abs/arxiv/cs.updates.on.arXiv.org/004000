To make better use of file diversity provided by random caching and improve the successful transmission
probability (STP) of a file, we consider retransmissions with random discontinuous transmission
(DTX) in a large-scale cache-enabled heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) employing random
caching. We analyze and optimize the STP in two mobility scenarios, i.e., the high mobility scenario
and the static scenario. First, in each scenario, by using tools from stochastic geometry, we obtain
the closed-form expressions for the STP in the general and low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
threshold regimes, respectively. The analysis shows that a larger caching probability corresponds
to a higher STP in both scenarios; random DTX can improve the STP in the static scenario and its benefit
gradually diminishes when mobility increases. Then, in each scenario, we consider the maximization
of the STP with respect to the caching probability and the BS activity probability, which is a challenging
non-convex optimization problem. In particular, in the high mobility scenario, we obtain a globally
optimal solution using interior point method. In the static scenario, we develop a low-complexity
iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using alternating optimization. Finally, numerical
results show that the proposed solutions achieve significant gains over existing baseline schemes
and can well adapt to the changes of the system parameters to wisely utilize storage resources and
transmission opportunities.
