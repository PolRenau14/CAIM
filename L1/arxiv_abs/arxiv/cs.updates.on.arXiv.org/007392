The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that will replace
the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018. The most significant change is a huge increase
in the maximum fine that can be levied for breaches of the regulation. Yet fewer than half of UK companies
are fully aware of GDPR - and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit
vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become compliant is therefore expected, and numerous
companies are starting to offer advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In
such an environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by providing
best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out
assessments. The paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or
machine learning techniques may be relevant: * Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct;
* Supporting risk assessments; * Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies that
perform automatic profiling; * Complying with the new regulations concerning recognising and
reporting breaches of security. It concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas.
The requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state for explanation
and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches are likely to be more helpful than
machine learning approaches. However, there may be good business reasons to take a different approach
in some circumstances.
