In the aftermath of an extreme natural hazard, community residents must have access to functioning
food retailers to maintain food security. Food security is dependent on supporting critical infrastructure
systems, including electricity, potable water, and transportation. An understanding of response
of such interdependent networks and the process of post-disaster recovery is the cornerstone of
an efficient emergency management plan. In this study, the interconnectedness among different
critical facilities, such as electrical power networks, water networks, highway bridges, and
food retailers is modeled. The study considers various sources of uncertainty and complexity in
the recovery process of a community to capture the stochastic behavior of the spatially distributed
infrastructure systems. The study utilizes an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework
to allocate resources to restore infrastructure components efficiently. The proposed ADP scheme
enables us to identify near-optimal restoration decisions at the community level. Furthermore,
we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to complement the proposed ADP framework and to identify
near-optimal actions accurately. In the sequel, we use the City of Gilroy, California, USA to illustrate
the applicability of the proposed methodology following a severe earthquake. The approach can
be implemented efficiently to identify practical policy interventions to hasten recovery of food
systems and to reduce adverse food-insecurity impacts for other hazards and communities.
