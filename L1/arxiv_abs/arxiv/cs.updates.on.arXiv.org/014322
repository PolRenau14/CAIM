Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently, many deep networks
derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various medical image segmentation tasks. However,
in most of the cases, networks similar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with
lots of discontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks, we propose
the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask predictions also perform contour
prediction and distance map estimation. The contour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness
in the segmentation predictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel
architecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders (thus having a shape
of $\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask prediction and other two decoders to learn
the auxiliary tasks of contour detection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary
tasks helps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a new joint loss
function for the proposed architecture. The loss function consists of a weighted combination of
Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square Error loss. We have used two publicly available datasets:
1) Origa dataset for the task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for
the task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted extensive experiments using
our network to show our model gives better results in terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.
