Kinship verification has a number of applications such as organizing large collections of images
and recognizing resemblances among humans. In this research, first, a human study is conducted
to understand the capabilities of human mind and to identify the discriminatory areas of a face that
facilitate kinship-cues. Utilizing the information obtained from the human study, a hierarchical
Kinship Verification via Representation Learning (KVRL) framework is utilized to learn the representation
of different face regions in an unsupervised manner. We propose a novel approach for feature representation
termed as filtered contractive deep belief networks (fcDBN). The proposed feature representation
encodes relational information present in images using filters and contractive regularization
penalty. A compact representation of facial images of kin is extracted as an output from the learned
model and a multi-layer neural network is utilized to verify the kin accurately. A new WVU Kinship
Database is created which consists of multiple images per subject to facilitate kinship verification.
The results show that the proposed deep learning framework (KVRL-fcDBN) yields stateof-the-art
kinship verification accuracy on the WVU Kinship database and on four existing benchmark datasets.
Further, kinship information is used as a soft biometric modality to boost the performance of face
verification via product of likelihood ratio and support vector machine based approaches. Using
the proposed KVRL-fcDBN framework, an improvement of over 20% is observed in the performance of
face verification.
