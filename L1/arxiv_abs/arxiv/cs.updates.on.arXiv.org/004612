Automatic Term Extraction deals with the extraction of terminology from a domain specific corpus,
and has long been an established research area in data and knowledge acquisition. ATE remains a challenging
task as it is known that there is no existing ATE methods that can consistently outperform others
in any domain. This work adopts a refreshed perspective to this problem: instead of searching for
such a 'one-size-fit-all' solution that may never exist, we propose to develop generic methods
to 'enhance' existing ATE methods. We introduce SemRe-Rank, the first method based on this principle,
to incorporate semantic relatedness - an often overlooked venue - into an existing ATE method to
further improve its performance. SemRe-Rank incorporates word embeddings into a personalised
PageRank process to compute 'semantic importance' scores for candidate terms from a graph of semantically
related words (nodes), which are then used to revise the scores of candidate terms computed by a base
ATE algorithm. Extensively evaluated with 13 state-of-the-art base ATE methods on four datasets
of diverse nature, it is shown to have achieved widespread improvement over all base methods and
across all datasets, with up to 15 percentage points when measured by the Precision in the top ranked
K candidate terms (Precision at top K), or 28 percentage points in terms of F1. Compared to an alternative
approach built on the well-known TextRank algorithm, SemRe-Rank can potentially outperform by
up to 8 points in Precision at top K, or up to 17 points in F1.
