Mexico's National Institute of Geriatrics (INGER) is the national research center of reference
for matters related to human aging. INGER scientists perform basic, clinical and demographic research
which may imply different scientific cultures working together in the same specialized institution.
In this paper, by a combination of text mining, co-authorship network analysis and agent-based
modeling we analyzed and modeled the team assembly practices and the structure of the knowledge
produced by scientists from INGER. Our results showed a weak connection between basic and clinical
research, and the emergence of a highly connected academic leadership. Importantly, basic and
clinical-demographic researchers exhibited different team assembly strategies: Basic researchers
tended to form larger teams mainly with external collaborators while clinical and demographic
researchers formed smaller teams that very often incorporated internal (INGER) collaborators.
We showed how these two different ways to form research teams impacted the organization of knowledge
produced at INGER. Following these observations, we modeled, via agent-based modeling, the coexistence
of different scientific cultures (basic and clinical research) exhibiting different team assembly
strategies in the same institution. Our agent model successfully reproduced the current situation
of INGER. Moreover, by modifying the values of homophily we obtain alternative scenarios in which
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research could be done.
