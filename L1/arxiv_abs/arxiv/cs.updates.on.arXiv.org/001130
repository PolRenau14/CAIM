Background: Biological data often originate from samples containing mixtures of subpopulations,
corresponding e.g. to distinct cellular phenotypes. However, identification of distinct subpopulations
may be difficult if biological measurements yield distributions that are not easily separable.
Results: We present Multiresolution Correlation Analysis (MCA), a method for visually identifying
subpopulations based on the local pairwise correlation between covariates, without needing to
define an a priori interaction scale. We demonstrate that MCA facilitates the identification of
differentially regulated subpopulations in simulated data from a small gene regulatory network,
followed by application to previously published single-cell qPCR data from mouse embryonic stem
cells. We show that MCA recovers previously identified subpopulations, provides additional insight
into the underlying correlation structure, reveals potentially spurious compartmentalizations,
and provides insight into novel subpopulations. Conclusions: MCA is a useful method for the identification
of subpopulations in low-dimensional expression data, as emerging from qPCR or FACS measurements.
With MCA it is possible to investigate the robustness of covariate correlations with respect subpopulations,
graphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to differential regulation
between pairs of covariates. MCA thus provides a framework for investigation of expression correlations
for genes of interests and biological hypothesis generation.
