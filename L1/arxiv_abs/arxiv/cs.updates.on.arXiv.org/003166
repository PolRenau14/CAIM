Multi-port memory controllers (MPMCs) have become increasingly important in many modern applications
due to the tremendous growth in bandwidth requirement. Many approaches so far have focused on improving
either the memory access latency or the bandwidth utilization for specific applications. Moreover,
the application systems are likely to require certain adjustments to connect with an MPMC, since
the MPMC interface is limited to a single-clock and single data-width domain. In this paper, we propose
efficient techniques to improve the flexibility, latency, and bandwidth of an MPMC. Firstly, MPMC
interfaces employ a pair of dual-clock dual-port FIFOs at each port, so any multi-clock multi-data-width
application system can connect to an MPMC without requiring extra resources. Secondly, memory
access latency is significantly reduced because parallel FIFOs temporarily keep the data transfer
between the application system and memory. Lastly, a proposed arbitration scheme, namely window-based
first-come-first-serve, considerably enhances the bandwidth utilization. Depending on the
applications, MPMC can be properly configured by updating several internal configuration registers.
The experimental results in an Altera Cyclone FPGA prove that MPMC is fully operational at 150 MHz
and supports up to 32 concurrent connections at various clocks and data widths. More significantly,
achieved bandwidth utilization is approximately 93.2% of the theoretical bandwidth, and the access
latency is minimized as compared to previous designs.
