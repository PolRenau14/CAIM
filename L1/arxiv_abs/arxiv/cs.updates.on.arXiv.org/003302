Motion planning in multi-contact scenarios has recently gathered interest within the legged robotics
community, however actuator force/torque limits are rarely considered. We believe that these
limits gain paramount importance when the complexity of the terrains to be traversed increases.
For this reason we propose two new six-dimensional bounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench
Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible Wrench Polytope (FWP). We define the AWP as the set of all the wrenches
that a robot can generate on its own Center of Mass (CoM) while considering its actuation limits.
This considers the admissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current configuration
and actuation capabilities but does not include features of the environment such as the contact
normal or the friction coefficient. These are considered by the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC); the AWP
can therefore be seen as complementary with respect to the CWC. The intersection of the AWP and of
the CWC results in a polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real robot capabilities,
while maintaining the same compact representation. We explain how to efficiently compute the vertex-description
of the FWP and we also introduce a new locomotion stability metric based on the FWP, that we call feasibility
margin, which allows us to optimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches. Based on this,
we present an implementation of a motion planner for our quadruped robot HyQ that provides online
CoM trajectories that are guaranteed to be stable and actuation-consistent.
