The primary function of memory allocators is to allocate and deallocate chunks of memory primarily
through the malloc API. Many memory allocators also implement other API extensions, such as deriving
the size of an allocated object from the object's pointer, or calculating the base address of an allocation
from an interior pointer. In this paper, we propose a general purpose extended allocator API built
around these common extensions. We argue that such extended APIs have many applications and demonstrate
several use cases, such as (manual) memory error detection, meta data storage, typed pointers and
compact data-structures. Because most existing allocators were not designed for the extended
API, traditional implementations are expensive or not possible. Recently, the LowFat allocator
for heap and stack objects has been developed. The LowFat allocator is an implementation of the idea
of low-fat pointers, where object bounds information (size and base) are encoded into the native
machine pointer representation itself. The "killer app" for low-fat pointers is automated bounds
check instrumentation for program hardening and bug detection. However, the LowFat allocator
can also be used to implement highly optimized version of the extended allocator API, which makes
the new applications (listed above) possible. In this paper, we implement and evaluate several
applications based efficient memory allocator API extensions using low-fat pointers. We also
extend the LowFat allocator to cover global objects for the first time.
