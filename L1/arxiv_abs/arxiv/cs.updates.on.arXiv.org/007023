The public blockchain was originally conceived to process monetary transactions in a peer-to-peer
network while preventing double-spending. It has since been extended to numerous other applications
including execution of programs that exist on the blockchain called "smart contracts." Smart contracts
have a major limitation, namely they only operate on data that is on the blockchain. Trusted entities
called oracles attest to external data in order to bring it onto the blockchain but they do so without
the robust security guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn
oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper introduces Astraea,
a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides the truth or falsity of propositions.
Players fall into two roles: voters and certifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that
is resistant to adversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role
so they are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also presents a formal analysis
of the parameters behind the system to measure the probability of an adversary with bounded funds
being able to successfully manipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters
can be set to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult---a desirable feature for the system. Further,
this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash equilibrium exists where all rational
players are forced to behave honestly.
