Visual object tracking is a significant computer vision task which can be applied to many domains
such as visual surveillance, human computer interaction, and video compression. In the literature,
researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models. To help readers swiftly learn the recent
advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides
a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based
architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this
survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages:
visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized
and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of
interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The contributions
of this survey are four-fold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according
to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical
modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction
mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each
type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from
a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth, the existing benchmark resources (e.g., source
code and video datasets) are examined in this survey.
