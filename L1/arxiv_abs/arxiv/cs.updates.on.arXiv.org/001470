Whenever human beings interact with each other, they exchange or express opinions, emotions, and
sentiments. These opinions can be expressed in text, speech or images. Analysis of these sentiments
is one of the popular research areas of present day researchers. Sentiment analysis, also known
as opinion mining tries to identify or classify these sentiments or opinions into two broad categories
- positive and negative. In recent years, the scientific community has taken a lot of interest in
analyzing sentiment in textual data available in various social media platforms. Much work has
been done on social media conversations, blog posts, newspaper articles and various narrative
texts. However, when it comes to identifying emotions from scientific papers, researchers have
faced some difficulties due to the implicit and hidden nature of opinion. By default, citation instances
are considered inherently positive in emotion. Popular ranking and indexing paradigms often neglect
the opinion present while citing. In this paper, we have tried to achieve three objectives. First,
we try to identify the major sentiment in the citation text and assign a score to the instance. We have
used a statistical classifier for this purpose. Secondly, we have proposed a new index (we shall
refer to it hereafter as M-index) which takes into account both the quantitative and qualitative
factors while scoring a paper. Thirdly, we developed a ranking of research papers based on the M-index.
We also try to explain how the M-index impacts the ranking of scientific papers.
