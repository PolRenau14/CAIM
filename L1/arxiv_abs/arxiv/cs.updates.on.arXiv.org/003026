This paper presents an adaptive and intelligent sparse model for digital image sampling and recovery.
In the proposed sampler, we adaptively determine the number of required samples for retrieving
image based on space-frequency-gradient information content of image patches. By leveraging
texture in space, sparsity locations in DCT domain, and directional decomposition of gradients,
the sampler structure consists of a combination of uniform, random, and nonuniform sampling strategies.
For reconstruction, we model the recovery problem as a two-state cellular automaton to iteratively
restore image with scalable windows from generation to generation. We demonstrate the recovery
algorithm quickly converges after a few generations for an image with arbitrary degree of texture.
For a given number of measurements, extensive experiments on standard image-sets, infra-red,
and mega-pixel range imaging devices show that the proposed measurement matrix considerably increases
the overall recovery performance, or equivalently decreases the number of sampled pixels for a
specific recovery quality compared to random sampling matrix and Gaussian linear combinations
employed by the state-of-the-art compressive sensing methods. In practice, the proposed measurement-adaptive
sampling/recovery framework includes various applications from intelligent compressive imaging-based
acquisition devices to computer vision and graphics, and image processing technology. Simulation
codes are available online for reproduction purposes.
