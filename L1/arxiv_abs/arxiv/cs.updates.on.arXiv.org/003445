Drones have created a new threat to people's privacy. We are now in an era in which anyone with a drone
equipped with a video camera can use it to invade a subject's privacy by streaming the subject in his/her
private space over an encrypted first person view (FPV) channel. Although many methods have been
suggested to detect nearby drones, they all suffer from the same shortcoming: they cannot identify
exactly what is being captured, and therefore they fail to distinguish between the legitimate use
of a drone (for example, to use a drone to film a selfie from the air) and illegitimate use that invades
someone's privacy (when the same operator uses the drone to stream the view into the window of his
neighbor's apartment), a distinction that in some cases depends on the orientation of the drone's
video camera rather than on the drone's location. In this paper we shatter the commonly held belief
that the use of encryption to secure an FPV channel prevents an interceptor from extracting the POI
that is being streamed. We show methods that leverage physical stimuli to detect whether the drone's
camera is directed towards a target in real time. We investigate the influence of changing pixels
on the FPV channel (in a lab setup). Based on our observations we demonstrate how an interceptor can
perform a side-channel attack to detect whether a target is being streamed by analyzing the encrypted
FPV channel that is transmitted from a real drone (DJI Mavic) in two use cases: when the target is a
private house and when the target is a subject.
