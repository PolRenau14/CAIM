Themed collocated events, such as conferences, workshops, and seminars, invite people with related
life experiences to connect with each other. In this era when people record lives through the Internet,
individual experiences exist in different forms of digital contents. People share digital life
records during collocated events, such as sharing blogs they wrote, Twitter posts they forwarded,
and books they have read. However, connecting experiences during collocated events are challenging.
Not only one is blind to the large contents of others, identifying related experiential items depends
on how well experiences are retrieved. The collection of personal contents from all participants
forms a valuable group repository, from which connections between experiences can be mined. Visualizing
same or related experiences inspire conversations and support social exchange. Common topics
in group content also help participants generate new perspectives about the collocated group.
Advances in machine learning and data visualization provide automated approaches to process large
data and enable interactions with data repositories. This position paper promotes the idea of event
mining: how to utilize state-of-the-art data processing and visualization techniques to design
event mining systems for connecting experiences during collocated activities. We discuss empirical
and constructive problems in this design space, and our preliminary study of deploying a tabletop-based
system, BlogCloud, which supports experience re-visitation and exchange with machine-learning
and data visualization.
