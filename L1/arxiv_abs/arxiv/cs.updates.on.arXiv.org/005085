Malicious email attachments are a growing delivery vector for malware. While machine learning
has been successfully applied to portable executable (PE) malware detection, we ask, can we extend
similar approaches to detect malware across heterogeneous file types commonly found in email attachments?
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying machine learning as a static countermeasure
to detect several types of malicious email attachments including Microsoft Office documents and
Zip archives. To this end, we collected a dataset of over 5 million malicious/benign Microsoft Office
documents from VirusTotal for evaluation as well as a dataset of benign Microsoft Office documents
from the Common Crawl corpus, which we use to provide more realistic estimates of thresholds for
false positive rates on in-the-wild data. We also collected a dataset of approximately 500k malicious/benign
Zip archives, which we scraped using the VirusTotal service, on which we performed a separate evaluation.
We analyze predictive performance of several classifiers on each of the VirusTotal datasets using
a 70/30 train/test split on first seen time, evaluating feature and classifier types that have been
applied successfully in commercial antimalware products and R&D contexts. Using deep neural networks
and gradient boosted decision trees, we are able to obtain ROC curves with > 0.99 AUC on both Microsoft
Office document and Zip archive datasets. Discussion of deployment viability in various antimalware
contexts is provided.
