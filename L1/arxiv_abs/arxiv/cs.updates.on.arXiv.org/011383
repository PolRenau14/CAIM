In Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), due to inter-subject non-stationarities of electroencephalogram
(EEG), classifiers are trained and tested using EEG from the same subject. When physical disabilities
bottleneck the natural modality of performing a task, acquisition of ample training data is difficult
which practically obstructs classifier training. Previous works have tackled this problem by
generalizing the feature space amongst multiple subjects including the test subject. This work
aims at knowledge transfer to classify EEG of the target subject using a classifier trained with
the EEG of another unit source subject. A many-objective optimization framework is proposed where
optimal weights are obtained for projecting features in another dimension such that single source-trained
target EEG classification performance is maximized with the modified features. To validate the
approach, motor imagery tasks from the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa are classified using power
spectral density based features and linear support vector machine. Several performance metrics,
improvement in accuracy, sensitivity to the dimension of the projected space, assess the efficacy
of the proposed approach. Addressing single-source training promotes independent living of differently-abled
individuals by reducing assistance from others. The proposed approach eliminates the requirement
of EEG from multiple source subjects and is applicable to any existing feature extractors and classifiers.
