The recent emergence of the small cloud (SC), both in concept and in practice, has been driven mainly
by issues related to service cost and complexity of commercial cloud providers (e.g., Amazon) employing
massive data centers. However, the resource inelasticity problem faced by the SCs due to their relatively
scarce resources (e.g., virtual machines) might lead to a potential degradation of customer QoS
and loss of revenue. A proposed solution to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between
competing SCs to alleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise [1]. Based on this
idea, a recent effort ([2]) proposed SC-Share, a performance-driven static market model for competitive
small cloud environments that results in an efficient market equilibrium jointly optimizing customer
QoS satisfaction and SC revenue generation. However, an important non-obvious question still
remains to be answered, without which SC sharing markets may not be guaranteed to sustain in the long-run
- is it still possible to achieve a stable market efficient state when the supply of SC resources is
dynamic in nature and there is a variation of customer demand over time? In this paper, we address
the problem of efficient market design for SC resource sharing in dynamic environments. We answer
our previous question in the affirmative through the use of Arrow and Hurwicz's disequilibrium
process [3], [4] in economics, and the gradient play technique in game theory that allows us to iteratively
converge upon efficient and stable market equilibria
