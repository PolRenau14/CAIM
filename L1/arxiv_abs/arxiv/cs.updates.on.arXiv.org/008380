Background. Test resources are usually limited and therefore it is often not possible to completely
test an application before a release. To cope with the problem of scarce resources, development
teams can apply defect prediction to identify fault-prone code regions. However, defect prediction
tends to low precision in cross-project prediction scenarios. Aims. We take an inverse view on defect
prediction and aim to identify methods that can be deferred when testing because they contain hardly
any faults due to their code being "trivial". We expect that characteristics of such methods might
be project-independent, so that our approach could improve cross-project predictions. Method.
We compute code metrics and apply association rule mining to create rules for identifying methods
with low fault risk. We conduct an empirical study to assess our approach with six Java open-source
projects containing precise fault data at the method level. Results. Our results show that inverse
defect prediction can identify approx. 32-44% of the methods of a project to have a low fault risk;
on average, they are about six times less likely to contain a fault than other methods. In cross-project
predictions with larger, more diversified training sets, identified methods are even eleven times
less likely to contain a fault. Conclusions. Inverse defect prediction supports the efficient
allocation of test resources by identifying methods that can be treated with less priority in testing
activities and is well applicable in cross-project prediction scenarios.
