Variational Level Set (VLS) has been a widely used method in medical segmentation. However, segmentation
accuracy in the VLS method dramatically decreases when dealing with intervening factors such as
lighting, shadows, colors, etc. Additionally, results are quite sensitive to initial settings
and are highly dependent on the number of iterations. In order to address these limitations, the
proposed method incorporates VLS into deep learning by defining a novel end-to-end trainable model
called as Deep Recurrent Level Set (DRLS). The proposed DRLS consists of three layers, i.e, Convolutional
layers, Deconvolutional layers with skip connections and LevelSet layers. Brain tumor segmentation
is taken as an instant to illustrate the performance of the proposed DRLS. Convolutional layer learns
visual representation of brain tumor at different scales. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion
of the image, deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high quality
feature map. Level-Set Layer drives the contour towards the brain tumor. In each step, the Convolutional
Layer is fed with the LevelSet map to obtain a brain tumor feature map. This in turn serves as input
for the LevelSet layer in the next step. The experimental results have been obtained on BRATS2013,
BRATS2015 and BRATS2017 datasets. The proposed DRLS model improves both computational time and
segmentation accuracy when compared to the the classic VLS-based method. Additionally, a fully
end-to-end system DRLS achieves state-of-the-art segmentation on brain tumors.
