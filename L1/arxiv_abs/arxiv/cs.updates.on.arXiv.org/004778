With product customization an emerging business opportunity, organizations must find ways to
collaborate and enable sharing of information in an inherently trustless network. In this paper,
we propose - "FabRec": a decentralized approach to handle manufacturing information generated
by various organizations using blockchain technology. We propose a system in which a decentralized
network of manufacturing machines and computing nodes can enable automated transparency of an
organization's capability, third party verification of such capability through a trail of past
historic events and automated mechanisms to drive paperless contracts between participants using
'smart contracts'. Our system decentralizes critical information about the manufacturer and
makes it available on a peer-to-peer network composed of fiduciary nodes to ensure transparency
and data provenance through a verifiable audit trail. We present a testbed platform through a combination
of manufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to demonstrate mechanisms
through which a consortium of disparate organizations can communicate through a decentralized
network. Our prototype testbed demonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized
network for verification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be autonomously
initiated in the physical world. This paper intends to expose system elements in preparation for
much larger field tests through the working prototype and discusses the future potential of blockchain
for manufacturing IT.
