Mining of spatial data is an enabling technology for mobile services, Internet-connected cars,
and the Internet of Things. But the very distinctiveness of spatial data that drives utility, can
cost user privacy. Past work has focused upon points and trajectories for differentially-private
release. In this work, we continue the tradition of privacy-preserving spatial analytics, focusing
not on point or path data, but on planar spatial regions. Such data represents the area of a user's
most frequent visitation---such as "around home and nearby shops". Specifically we consider the
differentially-private release of data structures that support range queries for counting users'
spatial regions. Counting planar regions leads to unique challenges not faced in existing work.
A user's spatial region that straddles multiple data structure cells can lead to duplicate counting
at query time. We provably avoid this pitfall by leveraging the Euler characteristic for the first
time with differential privacy. To address the increased sensitivity of range queries to spatial
region data, we calibrate privacy-preserving noise using bounded user region size and a constrained
inference that uses robust least absolute deviations. Our novel constrained inference reduces
noise and promotes covertness by (privately) imposing consistency. We provide a full end-to-end
theoretical analysis of both differential privacy and high-probability utility for our approach
using concentration bounds. A comprehensive experimental study on several real-world datasets
establishes practical validity.
