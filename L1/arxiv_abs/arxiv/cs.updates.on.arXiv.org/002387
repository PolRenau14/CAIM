As Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) move into the petascale age, where the output from global
high-resolution model runs can be of the order of hundreds of terabytes in size, tools to analyse
the output of these models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian Ocean Analysis, where virtual particles
are tracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse OGCM output,
by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic particulates. However, the current
software stack of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing
complexity, scale and need for customisation of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes
are developed for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual particles at
runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the new Parcels code, which was designed from the ground up
to be sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We highlight its API design that combines
flexibility and customisation with the ability to optimise for HPC workflows, following the paradigm
of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python, utilising the wide range
of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating low-level C-code and using
Just-In-Time compilation for performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example
of its API, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven idealised test cases. This version~0.9
of Parcels is focussed on laying out the API, with future work concentrating on optimisation, efficiency
and at-runtime coupling with OGCMs.
