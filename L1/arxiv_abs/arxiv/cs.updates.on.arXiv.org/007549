Quantum circuits for mathematical functions such as division are necessary to use quantum computers
for scientific computing. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T gates can easily be made fault-tolerant
but the T gate is very costly to implement. The small number of qubits available in existing quantum
computers adds another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing T-count and qubit
cost have become important optimization goals. The design of quantum circuits for integer division
has caught the attention of researchers and designs have been proposed in the literature. However,
these designs suffer from excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce significant
garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to eliminate these outputs. In this
work, we propose two quantum integer division circuits. The first proposed quantum integer division
circuit is based on the restoring division algorithm and the second proposed design implements
the non-restoring division algorithm. Both proposed designs are optimized in terms of T-count,
T-depth and qubits. Both proposed quantum circuit designs are based on (i) a quantum subtractor,
(ii) a quantum adder-subtractor circuit, and (iii) a novel quantum conditional addition circuit.
Our proposed restoring division circuit achieves average T-count savings from $79.03 \%$ to $91.69
\%$ compared to the existing works. Our proposed non-restoring division circuit achieves average
T-count savings from $49.75 \%$ to $90.37 \%$ compared to the existing works. Further, both our proposed
designs have linear T-depth.
