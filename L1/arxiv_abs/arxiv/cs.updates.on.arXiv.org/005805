Estimating the effects of introducing a range of smart mobility solutions within an urban area is
a crucial concern in urban planning. The lack of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the assessment
of mobility initiatives, forces local public authorities and mobility service providers to base
their decisions on guidelines derived from common heuristics and best practices. These approaches
can help planners in shaping mobility solutions, but given the high number of variables to consider
the effects are not guaranteed. Therefore, a solution conceived respecting the available guidelines
can result in a failure in a different context. In particular, difficult aspects to consider are
the interactions between different mobility services available in a given urban area, and the acceptance
of a given mobility initiative by the inhabitants of the area. In order to fill this gap, we introduce
Tangramob, an agent-based simulation framework capable of assessing the impacts of a Smart Mobility
Initiative (SMI) within an urban area of interest. Tangramob simulates how urban traffic is expected
to evolve as citizens start experiencing the newly offered traveling solutions. This allows decision
makers to evaluate the efficacy of their initiatives taking into account the current urban system.
In this paper we provide an overview of the simulation framework along with its design. To show the
potential of Tangramob, 3 mobility initiatives are simulated and compared on the same scenario.
This shows how it is possible to perform comparative experiments so as to align mobility initiatives
to the user goals.
