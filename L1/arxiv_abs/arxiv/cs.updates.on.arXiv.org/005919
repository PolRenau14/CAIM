Every Internet communication typically involves a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup for the destination
server that the client wants to communicate with. Operators of DNS recursive resolvers---the machines
that receive a client's query for a domain name, resolve it to a corresponding IP address, and ultimately
return the IP address to the client---can learn significant information about client activity.
Past work, for example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web browsing
activity to the types of devices that a user has in his or her home (and the extent to which they are being
used). Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various third parties
have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user's DNS queries from his or her Internet service
provider. Yet, these systems merely transfer trust to a different third party. We argue that no single
party should be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those queries.
To this end, we present Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation
between clients and their queries. To do so, ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative
servers for the ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they receive,
but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated these queries. We present an initial
deployment of ODNS; our experiments show that ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both
for individual queries and for web page loads, and is compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.
