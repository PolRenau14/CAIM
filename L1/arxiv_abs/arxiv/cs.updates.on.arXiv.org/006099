We construct pseudorandom generators of seed length $\tilde{O}(\log(n)\cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$
that $\epsilon$-fool ordered read-once branching programs (ROBPs) of width $3$ and length $n$.
For unordered ROBPs, we construct pseudorandom generators with seed length $\tilde{O}(\log(n)
\cdot \mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. This is the first improvement for pseudorandom generators
fooling width $3$ ROBPs since the work of Nisan [Combinatorica, 1992]. Our constructions are based
on the `iterated milder restrictions' approach of Gopalan et al. [FOCS, 2012] (which further extends
the Ajtai-Wigderson framework [FOCS, 1985]), combined with the INW-generator [STOC, 1994] at
the last step (as analyzed by Braverman et al. [SICOMP, 2014]). For the unordered case, we combine
iterated milder restrictions with the generator of Chattopadhyay et al. [CCC, 2018]. Two conceptual
ideas that play an important role in our analysis are: (1) A relabeling technique allowing us to analyze
a relabeled version of the given branching program, which turns out to be much easier. (2) Treating
the number of colliding layers in a branching program as a progress measure and showing that it reduces
significantly under pseudorandom restrictions. In addition, we achieve nearly optimal seed-length
$\tilde{O}(\log(n/\epsilon))$ for the classes of: (1) read-once polynomials on $n$ variables,
(2) locally-monotone ROBPs of length $n$ and width $3$ (generalizing read-once CNFs and DNFs),
and (3) constant-width ROBPs of length $n$ having a layer of width $2$ in every consecutive $\mathrm{poly}\log(n)$
layers.
