Science is conducted collaboratively, often requiring the sharing of knowledge about computational
experiments. When experiments include only datasets, they can be shared using Uniform Resource
Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). An experiment, however, seldom includes
only datasets, but more often includes software, its past execution, provenance, and associated
documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method
for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a
necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments.
Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. Computational provenance
is often the key to enable such reuse. In this paper, we show how reusable research objects can utilize
provenance to correctly repeat a previous reference execution, to construct a subset of a research
object for partial reuse, and to reuse existing contents of a research object for modified reuse.
We describe two methods to summarize provenance that aid in understanding the contents and past
executions of a research object. The first method obtains a process-view by collapsing low-level
system information, and the second method obtains a summary graph by grouping related nodes and
edges with the goal to obtain a graph view similar to application workflow. Through detailed experiments,
we show the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms.
