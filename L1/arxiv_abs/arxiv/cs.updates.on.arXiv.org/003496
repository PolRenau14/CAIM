The state-of-the-art mobile edge applications are generating intense traffic and posing rigorous
latency requirements to service providers. While resource sharing across multiple service providers
can be a way to maximize the utilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized
repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status. Moreover, service
providers have to trust each other for resource allocation fairness, which is difficult because
of potential conflicts of interest. We propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to
make mobile edge application placement decisions for multiple service providers. We first formulate
a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for mobile edge application placement
scenarios. Based on our model, we present a heuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm.
As a decentralized public ledger, the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as the smart
contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hosts participating in the system.
The algorithm is agreed by all parties and the results will only be accepted by majority of the mining
nodes on the blockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting the consumer's latency
and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost. All placement transactions are stored
on the blockchain and are traceable by every mobile edge service provider and application vendor
who consumes resources at the mobile edge.
