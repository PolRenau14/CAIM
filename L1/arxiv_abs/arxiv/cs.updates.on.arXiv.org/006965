Purpose: The suppression of motion artefacts from MR images is a challenging task. The purpose of
this paper is to develop a standalone novel technique to suppress motion artefacts from MR images
using a data-driven deep learning approach. Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network
(CNN) was developed to remove motion artefacts in brain MR images. A CNN was trained on simulated
motion corrupted images to identify and suppress artefacts due to the motion. The network was an
encoder-decoder CNN architecture where the encoder decomposed the motion corrupted images into
a set of feature maps. The feature maps were then combined by the decoder network to generate a motion-corrected
image. The network was tested on an unseen simulated dataset and an experimental, motion corrupted
in vivo brain dataset. Results: The trained network was able to suppress the motion artefacts in
the simulated motion corrupted images, and the mean percentage error in the motion corrected images
was 2.69 % with a standard deviation of 0.95 %. The network was able to effectively suppress the motion
artefacts from the experimental dataset, demonstrating the generalisation capability of the
trained network. Conclusion: A novel and generic motion correction technique has been developed
that can suppress motion artefacts from motion corrupted MR images. The proposed technique is a
standalone post-processing method that does not interfere with data acquisition or reconstruction
parameters, thus making it suitable for a multitude of MR sequences.
