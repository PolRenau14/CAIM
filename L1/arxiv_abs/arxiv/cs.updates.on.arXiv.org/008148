We address the problem of decomposing a single image into reflectance and shading. The difficulty
comes from the fact that the components of image---the surface albedo, the direct illumination,
and the ambient illumination---are coupled heavily in observed image. We propose to infer the shading
by ordering pixels by their relative brightness, without knowing the absolute values of the image
components beforehand. The pairwise shading orders are estimated in two ways: brightness order
and low-order fittings of local shading field. The brightness order is a non-local measure, which
can be applied to any pair of pixels including those whose reflectance and shading are both different.
The low-order fittings are used for pixel pairs within local regions of smooth shading. Together,
they can capture both global order structure and local variations of the shading. We propose a Consistency-aware
Selective Fusion (CSF) to integrate the pairwise orders into a globally consistent order. The iterative
selection process solves the conflicts between the pairwise orders obtained by different estimation
methods. Inconsistent or unreliable pairwise orders will be automatically excluded from the fusion
to avoid polluting the global order. Experiments on the MIT Intrinsic Image dataset show that the
proposed model is effective at recovering the shading including deep shadows. Our model also works
well on natural images from the IIW dataset, the UIUC Shadow dataset and the NYU-Depth dataset, where
the colors of direct lights and ambient lights are quite different.
