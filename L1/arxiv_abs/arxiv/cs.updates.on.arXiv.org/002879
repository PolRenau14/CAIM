Prior works, such as the Tallinn manual on the international law applicable to cyber warfare, focus
on the circumstances of cyber warfare. Many organizations are considering how to conduct cyber
warfare, but few have discussed methods to reduce, or even prevent, cyber conflict. A recent series
of publications started developing the framework of Cyber Peacekeeping (CPK) and its legal requirements.
These works assessed the current state of organizations such as ITU IMPACT, NATO CCDCOE and Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, and found that they did not satisfy requirements to effectively host
CPK activities. An assessment of organizations currently working in the areas related to CPK found
that the United Nations (UN) has mandates and organizational structures that appear to somewhat
overlap the needs of CPK. However, the UN's current approach to Peacekeeping cannot be directly
mapped to cyberspace. In this research we analyze the development of traditional Peacekeeping
in the United Nations, and current initiatives in cyberspace. Specifically, we will compare the
proposed CPK framework with the recent initiative of the United Nations named the 'Digital Blue
Helmets' as well as with other projects in the UN which helps to predict and mitigate conflicts. Our
goal is to find practical recommendations for the implementation of the CPK framework in the United
Nations, and to examine how responsibilities defined in the CPK framework overlap with those of
the 'Digital Blue Helmets' and the Global Pulse program.
