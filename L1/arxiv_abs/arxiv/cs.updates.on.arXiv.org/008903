The requirement of supporting both latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things
(IoT) applications is consistently boosting the necessity for integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud
infrastructure. Although there are a number of real-world frameworks attempt to support such integration,
they have many limitations from various perspectives including platform independence, security,
resource management and multi-application assistance. To address these limitations, we propose
a simplified but effective framework, named FogBus for facilitating end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud
integration. FogBus offers a platform independent interface to IoT applications and computing
instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers in building applications
but also helps users in running multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their
resources. In addition, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques
to secure operations on sensitive data. Because of its lightweight and cross platform software
systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost e_cient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeter as
IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis.
We also run several experiments on this computing environment varying FogBus settings. The experimental
results show that different FogBus settings can improve latency, energy, network and CPU usage
of the computing infrastructure.
