Graph Sparsification aims at compressing large graphs into smaller ones while preserving important
characteristics of the input graph. In this work we study Vertex Sparsifiers, i.e., sparsifiers
whose goal is to reduce the number of vertices. We focus on the following notions: (1) Given a digraph
$G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K \subset V$ with $|K| = k$, a (vertex) reachability sparsifier
of $G$ is a digraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$, $K \subset V_H$ that preserves all reachability information
among terminal pairs. In this work we introduce the notion of reachability-preserving minors (RPMs)
, i.e., we require $H$ to be a minor of $G$. We show any directed graph $G$ admits a RPM $H$ of size $O(k^3)$,
and if $G$ is planar, then the size of $H$ improves to $O(k^{2} \log k)$. We complement our upper-bound
by showing that there exists an infinite family of grids such that any RPM must have $\Omega(k^{2})$
vertices. (2) Given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K$ with $|K|=k$,
an exact (vertex) cut sparsifier of $G$ is a graph $H$ with $K \subset V_H$ that preserves the value
of minimum-cuts separating any bipartition of $K$. We show that planar graphs with all the $k$ terminals
lying on the same face admit exact cut sparsifiers of size $O(k^{2})$ that are also planar. Our result
extends to flow and distance sparsifiers. It improves the previous best-known bound of $O(k^22^{2k})$
for cut and flow sparsifiers by an exponential factor, and matches an $\Omega(k^2)$ lower-bound
for this class of graphs.
