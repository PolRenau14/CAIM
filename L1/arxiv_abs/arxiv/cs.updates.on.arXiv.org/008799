With the exponential growth of mobile data, there are increasing interests to deploy small cells
in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to underlay the conventional homogeneous macrocell network
as well as in exploiting device-to-device (D2D) communications to improve the efficiency of the
multicast service that supports content-based mobile applications. To compensate for high propagation
loss in the mmWave band, high-gain directional antennas have to be employed, while it is critical
to optimize multicast service in order to improve the network performance. In this paper, an efficient
multicast scheduling scheme is proposed for small cells in the mmWave band, called MD2D, where both
D2D communications in close proximity and multi-level antenna codebook are utilized. Specifically,
a user partition and multicast path planning algorithm is proposed to partition the users in the
multicast group into subsets and to determine the transmission node for each subset, so as to achieve
optimal utilization of D2D communications and multi-level antenna codebook. Then a multicast
scheduling algorithm schedules the transmission for each subset. Furthermore, in order to optimize
the network performance, the optimal choice of user partition thresholds is analyzed. Performance
evaluation demonstrate that the MD2D achieves the best performance, in terms of network throughput
and energy efficiency, compared with other existing schemes. MD2D improves the network throughput
compared with the second-best scheme by about 27\%.
