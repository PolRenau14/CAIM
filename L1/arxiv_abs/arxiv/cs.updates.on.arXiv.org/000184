In recent years, researchers in decision analysis and artificial intelligence (Al) have used Bayesian
belief networks to build models of expert opinion. Using standard methods drawn from the theory
of computational complexity, workers in the field have shown that the problem of probabilistic
inference in belief networks is difficult and almost certainly intractable. K N ET, a software environment
for constructing knowledge-based systems within the axiomatic framework of decision theory,
contains a randomized approximation scheme for probabilistic inference. The algorithm can, in
many circumstances, perform efficient approximate inference in large and richly interconnected
models of medical diagnosis. Unlike previously described stochastic algorithms for probabilistic
inference, the randomized approximation scheme computes a priori bounds on running time by analyzing
the structure and contents of the belief network. In this article, we describe a randomized algorithm
for probabilistic inference and analyze its performance mathematically. Then, we devote the major
portion of the paper to a discussion of the algorithm's empirical behavior. The results indicate
that the generation of good trials (that is, trials whose distribution closely matches the true
distribution), rather than the computation of numerous mediocre trials, dominates the performance
of stochastic simulation. Key words: probabilistic inference, belief networks, stochastic simulation,
computational complexity theory, randomized algorithms.
