In this manuscript, we introduce a real-time motion planning system based on the Baidu Apollo (open
source) autonomous driving platform. The developed system aims to address the industrial level-4
motion planning problem while considering safety, comfort and scalability. The system covers
multilane and single-lane autonomous driving in a hierarchical manner: (1) The top layer of the
system is a multilane strategy that handles lane-change scenarios by comparing lane-level trajectories
computed in parallel. (2) Inside the lane-level trajectory generator, it iteratively solves path
and speed optimization based on a Frenet frame. (3) For path and speed optimization, a combination
of dynamic programming and spline-based quadratic programming is proposed to construct a scalable
and easy-to-tune framework to handle traffic rules, obstacle decisions and smoothness simultaneously.
The planner is scalable to both highway and lower-speed city driving scenarios. We also demonstrate
the algorithm through scenario illustrations and on-road test results. The system described in
this manuscript has been deployed to dozens of Baidu Apollo autonomous driving vehicles since Apollo
v1.5 was announced in September 2017. As of May 16th, 2018, the system has been tested under 3,380
hours and approximately 68,000 kilometers (42,253 miles) of closed-loop autonomous driving under
various urban scenarios. The algorithm described in this manuscript is available at https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/modules/planning.
