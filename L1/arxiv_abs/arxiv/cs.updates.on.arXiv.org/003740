In this paper, we model a pixel as a linear combination of endmembers sampled from probability distributions
of Gaussian mixture models (GMM). The parameters of the GMM distributions are estimated using spectral
libraries. Abundances are estimated based on the distribution parameters. The advantage of this
algorithm is that the model size grows very slowly as a function of the library size. To validate this
method, we used data collected by the AVIRIS sensor over the Santa Barbara region: two 16 m spatial
resolution and two 4 m spatial resolution images. 64 validated regions of interest (ROI) (180 m by
180 m) were used to assess estimate accuracy. Ground truth was obtained using 1 m images leading to
the following 6 classes: turfgrass, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), paved, roof, soil,
and tree. Spectral libraries were built by manually identifying and extracting pure spectra from
both resolution images, resulting in 3,287 spectra at 16 m and 15,426 spectra at 4 m. We then unmixed
ROIs of each resolution using the following unmixing algorithms: the set-based algorithms MESMA
and AAM, and the distribution-based algorithms GMM, NCM, and BCM. The original libraries were used
for the distribution-based algorithms whereas set-based methods required a sophisticated reduction
method, resulting in reduced libraries of 61 spectra at 16 m and 95 spectra at 4 m. The results show
that GMM performs best among the distribution-based methods, producing comparable accuracy to
MESMA, and may be more robust across datasets.
