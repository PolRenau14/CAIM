In the context of fitness coaching or for rehabilitation purposes, the motor actions of a human participant
must be observed and analyzed for errors in order to provide effective feedback. This task is normally
carried out by human coaches, and it needs to be solved automatically in technical applications
that are to provide automatic coaching (e.g. training environments in VR). However, most coaching
systems only provide coarse information on movement quality, such as a scalar value per body part
that describes the overall deviation from the correct movement. Further, they are often limited
to static body postures or rather simple movements of single body parts. While there are many approaches
to distinguish between different types of movements (e.g., between walking and jumping), the detection
of more subtle errors in a motor performance is less investigated. We propose a novel approach to
classify errors in sports or rehabilitation exercises such that feedback can be delivered in a rapid
and detailed manner: Homogeneous sub-sequences of exercises are first temporally aligned via
Dynamic Time Warping. Next, we extract a feature vector from the aligned sequences, which serves
as a basis for feature selection using Random Forests. The selected features are used as input for
Support Vector Machines, which finally classify the movement errors. We compare our algorithm
to a well established state-of-the-art approach in time series classification, 1-Nearest Neighbor
combined with Dynamic Time Warping, and show our algorithm's superiority regarding classification
quality as well as computational cost.
