A cognitive model of human learning provides information about skills a learner must acquire to
perform accurately in a task domain. Cognitive models of learning are not only of scientific interest,
but are also valuable in adaptive online tutoring systems. A more accurate model yields more effective
tutoring through better instructional decisions. Prior methods of automated cognitive model
discovery have typically focused on well-structured domains, relied on student performance data
or involved substantial human knowledge engineering. In this paper, we propose Cognitive Representation
Learner (CogRL), a novel framework to learn accurate cognitive models in ill-structured domains
with no data and little to no human knowledge engineering. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly,
we show that representations learnt using CogRL can be used for accurate automatic cognitive model
discovery without using any student performance data in several ill-structured domains: Rumble
Blocks, Chinese Character, and Article Selection. This is especially effective and useful in domains
where an accurate human-authored cognitive model is unavailable or authoring a cognitive model
is difficult. Secondly, for domains where a cognitive model is available, we show that representations
learned through CogRL can be used to get accurate estimates of skill difficulty and learning rate
parameters without using any student performance data. These estimates are shown to highly correlate
with estimates using student performance data on an Article Selection dataset.
