With the growth of mobile devices and applications, the number of malicious software, or malware,
is rapidly increasing in recent years, which calls for the development of advanced and effective
malware detection approaches. Traditional methods such as signature-based ones cannot defend
users from an increasing number of new types of malware or rapid malware behavior changes. In this
paper, we propose a new Android malware detection approach based on deep learning and static analysis.
Instead of using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) only, we further analyze the source
code of Android applications and create their higher-level graphical semantics, which makes it
harder for attackers to evade detection. In particular, we use a call graph from method invocations
in an Android application to represent the application, and further analyze method attributes
to form a structured Program Representation Graph (PRG) with node attributes. Then, we use a graph
convolutional network (GCN) to yield a graph representation of the application by embedding the
entire graph into a dense vector, and classify whether it is a malware or not. To efficiently train
such a graph convolutional network, we propose a batch training scheme that allows multiple heterogeneous
graphs to be input as a batch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use graph representation
learning for malware detection. We conduct extensive experiments from real-world sample collections
and demonstrate that our developed system outperforms multiple other existing malware detection
techniques.
