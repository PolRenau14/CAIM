To improve the quality and efficiency of research, groups within the scientific community seek
to exploit the value of data sharing. Funders, institutions, and specialist organizations are
developing and implementing strategies to encourage or mandate data sharing within and across
disciplines, with varying degrees of success. Academic journals in ecology and evolution have
adopted several types of public data archiving policies requiring authors to make data underlying
scholarly manuscripts freely available. Yet anecdotes from the community and studies evaluating
data availability suggest that these policies have not obtained the desired effects, both in terms
of quantity and quality of available datasets. We conducted a qualitative, interview-based study
with journal editorial staff and other stakeholders in the academic publishing process to examine
how journals enforce data archiving policies. We specifically sought to establish who editors
and other stakeholders perceive as responsible for ensuring data completeness and quality in the
peer review process. Our analysis revealed little consensus with regard to how data archiving policies
should be enforced and who should hold authors accountable for dataset submissions. Themes in interviewee
responses included hopefulness that reviewers would take the initiative to review datasets and
trust in authors to ensure the completeness and quality of their datasets. We highlight problematic
aspects of these thematic responses and offer potential starting points for improvement of the
public data archiving process.
