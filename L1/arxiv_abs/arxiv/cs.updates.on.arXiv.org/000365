The process of collecting and organizing sets of observations represents a common theme throughout
the history of science. However, despite the ubiquity of scientists measuring, recording, and
analyzing the dynamics of different processes, an extensive organization of scientific time-series
data and analysis methods has never been performed. Addressing this, annotated collections of
over 35 000 real-world and model-generated time series and over 9000 time-series analysis algorithms
are analyzed in this work. We introduce reduced representations of both time series, in terms of
their properties measured by diverse scientific methods, and of time-series analysis methods,
in terms of their behaviour on empirical time series, and use them to organize these interdisciplinary
resources. This new approach to comparing across diverse scientific data and methods allows us
to organize time-series datasets automatically according to their properties, retrieve alternatives
to particular analysis methods developed in other scientific disciplines, and automate the selection
of useful methods for time-series classification and regression tasks. The broad scientific utility
of these tools is demonstrated on datasets of electroencephalograms, self-affine time series,
heart beat intervals, speech signals, and others, in each case contributing novel analysis techniques
to the existing literature. Highly comparative techniques that compare across an interdisciplinary
literature can thus be used to guide more focused research in time-series analysis for applications
across the scientific disciplines.
