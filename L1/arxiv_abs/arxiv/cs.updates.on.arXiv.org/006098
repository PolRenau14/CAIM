Fair division is the problem of dividing one or several goods amongst two or more agents in a way that
satisfies a suitable fairness criterion. These Notes provide a succinct introduction to the field.
We cover three main topics. First, we need to define what is to be understood by a "fair" allocation
of goods to individuals. We present an overview of the most important fairness criteria (as well
as the closely related criteria for economic efficiency) developed in the literature, together
with a short discussion of their axiomatic foundations. Second, we give an introduction to cake-cutting
procedures as an example of methods for fairly dividing a single divisible resource amongst a group
of individuals. Third, we discuss the combinatorial optimisation problem of fairly allocating
a set of indivisible goods to a group of agents, covering both centralised algorithms (similar to
auctions) and a distributed approach based on negotiation. While the classical literature on fair
division has largely developed within Economics, these Notes are specifically written for readers
with a background in Computer Science or similar, and who may be (or may wish to be) engaged in research
in Artificial Intelligence, Multiagent Systems, or Computational Social Choice. References
for further reading, as well as a small number of exercises, are included. Notes prepared for a tutorial
at the 11th European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS-2009), Torino, Italy, 31 August and 1 September
2009. Updated for a tutorial at the COST-ADT Doctoral School on Computational Social Choice, Estoril,
Portugal, 9--14 April 2010.
