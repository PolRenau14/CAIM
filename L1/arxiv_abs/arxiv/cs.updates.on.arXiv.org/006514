In Europe the 20% of the CT scans cover the thoracic region. The acquired images contain information
about the cardiovascular system that often remains latent due to the lack of contrast in the cardiac
area. On the other hand, the contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) represents an imaging
technique that allows to easily assess the cardiac chambers volumes and the contrast dynamics.
With this work we aim to face the problem of extraction and presentation of these latent information,
using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural networks. Starting from the extraction
of relevant features from the image without contrast medium, we try to re-map them on features typical
of CECT, to synthesize an image characterized by an attenuation in the cardiac chambers as if a virtually
iodine contrast medium was injected. The purposes are to guarantee an estimation of the left cardiac
chambers volume and to perform an evaluation of the contrast dynamics. Our approach is based on a
deconvolutional network trained on a set of 120 patients who underwent both CT acquisitions in the
same contrastographic arterial phase and the same cardiac phase. To ensure a reliable predicted
CECT image, in terms of values and morphology, a custom loss function is defined by combining an error
function to find a pixel-wise correspondence, which takes into account the similarity in term of
Hounsfield units between the input and output images and by a cross-entropy computed on the binarized
versions of the synthesized and of the real CECT image. The proposed method is finally tested on 20
subjects.
