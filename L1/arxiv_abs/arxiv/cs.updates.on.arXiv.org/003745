Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging improves on diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases by providing
images at high spatiotemporal resolution. Manual evaluation of these time-series, however, is
expensive and prone to biased and non-reproducible outcomes. In this paper, we present a method
that addresses named limitations by integrating segmentation and disease classification into
a fully automatic processing pipeline. We use an ensemble of UNet inspired architectures for segmentation
of cardiac structures such as the left and right ventricular cavity (LVC, RVC) and the left ventricular
myocardium (LVM) on each time instance of the cardiac cycle. For the classification task, information
is extracted from the segmented time-series in form of comprehensive features handcrafted to reflect
diagnostic clinical procedures. Based on these features we train an ensemble of heavily regularized
multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and a random forest classifier to predict the pathologic target class.
We evaluated our method on the ACDC dataset (4 pathology groups, 1 healthy group) and achieve dice
scores of 0.945 (LVC), 0.908 (RVC) and 0.905 (LVM) in a cross-validation over the training set (100
cases) and 0.950 (LVC), 0.923 (RVC) and 0.911 (LVM) on the test set (50 cases). We report a classification
accuracy of 94% on a training set cross-validation and 92% on the test set. Our results underpin the
potential of machine learning methods for accurate, fast and reproducible segmentation and computer-assisted
diagnosis (CAD).
