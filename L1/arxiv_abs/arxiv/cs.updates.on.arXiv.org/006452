Communities in social networks or graphs are sets of well-connected, overlapping vertices. The
effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is determined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth
communities and ability to scale with the size of the data. In this work, we provide three contributions.
First, we show that a popular measure of accuracy known as the F1 score, which is between 0 and 1, with
1 being perfect detection, has an information lower bound is 0.5. We provide a trivial algorithm
that produces communities with an F1 score of 0.5 for any graph! Somewhat surprisingly, we find that
popular algorithms such as modularity optimization, BigClam and CESNA have F1 scores less than
0.5 for the popular IMDB graph. To rectify this, as the second contribution we propose a generative
model for community formation, the sequential community graph, which is motivated by the formation
of social networks. Third, motivated by our generative model, we propose the leader-follower algorithm
(LFA). We prove that it recovers all communities for sequential community graphs by establishing
a structural result that sequential community graphs are chordal. For a large number of popular
social networks, it recovers communities with a much higher F1 score than other popular algorithms.
For the IMDB graph, it obtains an F1 score of 0.81. We also propose a modification to the LFA called
the fast leader-follower algorithm (FLFA) which in addition to being highly accurate, is also fast,
with a scaling that is almost linear in the network size.
