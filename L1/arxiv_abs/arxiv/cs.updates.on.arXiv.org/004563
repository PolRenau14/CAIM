An important goal for programmers is to minimize cost of identifying and correcting defects in source
code. Code review is commonly used for identifying programming defects. However, manual code review
has some shortcomings: a) it is time consuming, b) outcomes are subjective and depend on the skills
of reviewers. An automated approach for assisting in code reviews is thus highly desirable. We present
a tool for assisting in code review and results from our experiments evaluating the tool in different
scenarios. The tool leveraged content available from professional programmer support forums
(e.g. StackOverflow.com) to determine potential defectiveness of a given piece of source code.
The defectiveness is expressed on the scale of {Likely defective, Neutral, Unlikely to be defective}.
Basic idea employed in the tool is to: a) Identify a set P of discussion posts on StackOverflow such
that each p in P contains source code fragment(s) which sufficiently resemble the input code C being
reviewed. b) Determine the likelihood of C being defective by considering all p in P . A novel aspect
of our approach is to use document fingerprinting for comparing two pieces of source code. Our choice
of document fingerprinting technique is inspired by source code plagiarism detection tools where
it has proven to be very successful. In the experiments that we performed to verify effectiveness
of our approach source code samples from more than 300 GitHub open source repositories were taken
as input. A precision of more than 90% in identifying correct/relevant results has been achieved.
