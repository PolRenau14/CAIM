Modern platform-based design involves the application-specific extension of embedded processors
to fit customer requirements. To accomplish this task, the possibilities offered by recent custom/extensible
processors for tuning their instruction set and microarchitecture to the applications of interest
have to be exploited. A significant factor often determining the success of this process is the utomation
available in application analysis and custom instruction generation. In this paper we present
YARDstick, a design automation tool for custom processor development flows that focuses on generating
and evaluating application-specific hardware extensions. YARDstick is a building block for ASIP
development, integrating application analysis, custom instruction generation and selection
with user-defined compiler intermediate representations. In a YARDstick-enabled environment,
practical issues in traditional ASIP design are confronted efficiently; the exploration infrastructure
is liberated from compiler and simulator idiosyncrasies, since the ASIP designer is empowered
with the freedom of specifying the target architectures of choice and adding new implementations
of analyses and custom instruction generation/selection methods. To illustrate the capabilities
of the YARDstick approach, we present interesting exploration scenarios: quantifying the effect
of machine-dependent compiler optimizations and the selection of the target architecture in terms
of operation set and memory model on custom instruction generation/selection under different
input/output constraints.
