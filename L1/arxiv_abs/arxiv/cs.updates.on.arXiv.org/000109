A major computational burden, while performing document clustering, is the calculation of similarity
measure between a pair of documents. Similarity measure is a function that assigns a real number
between 0 and 1 to a pair of documents, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value
of zero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one indicates that
the documents are practically identical. Traditionally, vector-based models have been used for
computing the document similarity. The vector-based models represent several features present
in documents. These approaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics
of the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the words used to describe
these contexts are generally semantically related. Motivated by this fact, many researchers have
proposed seman-tic-based similarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external
thesauruses like WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic similarity measure
based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are rapidly becoming an industrial standard
for knowledge representation with a focus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed
into a topic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents is represented
as a correlation between the common patterns (sub-trees). The experimental studies on the text
mining datasets reveal that this new similarity measure is more effective as compared to commonly
used similarity measures in text clustering.
