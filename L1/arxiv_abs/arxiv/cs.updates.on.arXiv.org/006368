Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been shown to provide a good solution for classification
problems that utilize data obtained from vibrational spectroscopy. Moreover, CNNs are capable
of identification from noisy spectra without the need for additional preprocessing. However,
their application in practical spectroscopy is limited due to two shortcomings. The effectiveness
of the classification using CNNs drops rapidly when only a small number of spectra per substance
are available for training (which is a typical situation in real applications). Additionally,
to accommodate new, previously unseen substance classes, the network must be retrained which is
computationally intensive. Here we address these issues by reformulating a multi-class classification
problem with a large number of classes, but a small number of samples per class, to a binary classification
problem with sufficient data available for representation learning. Namely, we define the learning
task as identifying pairs of inputs as belonging to the same or different classes. We achieve this
using a Siamese convolutional neural network. A novel sampling strategy is proposed to address
the imbalance problem in training the Siamese Network. The trained network can effectively classify
samples of unseen substance classes using just a single reference sample (termed as one-shot learning
in the machine learning community). Our results demonstrate better accuracy than other practical
systems to date, while allowing effortless updates of the system's database with novel substance
classes.
