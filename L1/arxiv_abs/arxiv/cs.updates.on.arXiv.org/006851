In this paper, we consider multiple-antenna $K$-user interference channels with backhaul collaboration
in one side (among the transmitters or among the receivers) and investigate the trade-off between
the rate in the channel versus the communication load in the backhaul. In this investigation, we
focus on a first order approximation result, where the rate of the wireless channel is measured by
the degrees of freedom (DoF) per user, and the load of the backhaul is measured by the entropy of backhaul
messages per user normalized by $\log$ of transmit power, at high power regimes. This trade-off
is fully characterized for the case of even values of $K$, and approximately characterized for the
case of odd values of $K$, with vanishing approximation gap as $K$ grows. For full DoF, this result
establishes the optimality (approximately) of the most straightforward scheme, called Centralized
Scheme, in which the messages are collected at one of the nodes, centrally processed, and forwarded
back to each node. In addition, this result shows that the gain of the schemes, relying on distributed
processing, through pairwise communication among the nodes (e.g., cooperative alignment) does
not scale with the size of the network. For the converse, we develop a new outer-bound on the trade-off
based on splitting the set of collaborative nodes (transmitters or receivers) into two subsets,
and assuming full cooperation within each group. In continue, we further investigate the trade-off
for the cases, where the backhaul or the wireless links (interference channel) are not fully connected.
