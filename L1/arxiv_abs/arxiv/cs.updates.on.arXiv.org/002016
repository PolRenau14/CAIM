Modern embedded technology is a driving factor in satellite miniaturization, contributing to
a massive boom in satellite launches and a rapidly evolving new space industry. Miniaturized satellites,
however, suffer from low reliability, as traditional hardware-based fault-tolerance (FT) concepts
are ineffective for on-board computers (OBCs) utilizing modern systems-on-a-chip (SoC). Therefore,
larger satellites continue to rely on proven processors with large feature sizes. Software-based
concepts have largely been ignored by the space industry as they were researched only in theory,
and have not yet reached the level of maturity necessary for implementation. We present the first
integral, real-world solution to enable fault-tolerant general-purpose computing with modern
multiprocessor-SoCs (MPSoCs) for spaceflight, thereby enabling their use in future high-priority
space missions. The presented multi-stage approach consists of three FT stages, combining coarse-grained
thread-level distributed self-validation, FPGA reconfiguration, and mixed criticality to assure
long-term FT and excellent scalability for both resource constrained and critical high-priority
space missions. Early benchmark results indicate a drastic performance increase over state-of-the-art
radiation-hard OBC designs and considerably lower software- and hardware development costs.
This approach was developed for a 4-year European Space Agency (ESA) project, and we are implementing
a tiled MPSoC prototype jointly with two industrial partners.
