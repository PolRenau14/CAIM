Modern embedded technology is a driving factor in satellite miniaturization, contributing to
a massive boom in satellite launches and a rapidly evolving new space industry. Miniaturized satellites
however suffer from low reliability, as traditional hardware-based fault-tolerance (FT) concepts
are ineffective for on-board computers (OBCs) utilizing modern systems-on-a-chip (SoC). Larger
satellites therefore continue to rely on proven processors with large feature sizes. Software-based
concepts have largely been ignored by the space industry as they were researched only in theory,
and have not yet reached the level of maturity necessary for implementation. In related work, we
presented the first integral, real-world solution to enable fault-tolerant general-purpose
computing with modern multiprocessor-SoCs (MPSoCs) for spaceflight, thereby enabling their
use in future high-priority space missions. The presented multi-stage approach consists of three
FT stages, combining coarse-grained thread-level distributed self-validation, FPGA reconfiguration,
and mixed criticality to assure long-term FT and excellent scalability for both resource constrained
and critical high-priority space missions. As part of the ongoing implementation effort towards
a hardware prototype, several software implementations were achieved and tested. This document
contains an outline of the conducted tests, performance evaluation results, and supplementary
information not included in the actual paper. It is being continuously expanded and updated.
