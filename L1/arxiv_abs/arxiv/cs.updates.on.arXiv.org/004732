Given a model and a specification, the fundamental model-checking problem asks for algorithmic
verification of whether the model satisfies the specification. We consider graphs and Markov decision
processes (MDPs), which are fundamental models for reactive systems. One of the very basic specifications
that arise in verification of reactive systems is the strong fairness (aka Streett) objective.
Given different types of requests and corresponding grants, the objective requires that for each
type, if the request event happens infinitely often, then the corresponding grant event must also
happen infinitely often. All $\omega$-regular objectives can be expressed as Streett objectives
and hence they are canonical in verification. To handle the state-space explosion, symbolic algorithms
are required that operate on a succinct implicit representation of the system rather than explicitly
accessing the system. While explicit algorithms for graphs and MDPs with Streett objectives have
been widely studied, there has been no improvement of the basic symbolic algorithms. The worst-case
numbers of symbolic steps required for the basic symbolic algorithms are as follows: quadratic
for graphs and cubic for MDPs. In this work we present the first sub-quadratic symbolic algorithm
for graphs with Streett objectives, and our algorithm is sub-quadratic even for MDPs. Based on our
algorithmic insights we present an implementation of the new symbolic approach and show that it
improves the existing approach on several academic benchmark examples.
