Azure (the cloud service provided by Microsoft) is composed of physical computing units which are
called nodes. These nodes are controlled by a software component called Fabric Controller (FC),
which can consider the nodes to be in one of many different states such as Ready, Unhealthy, Booting,
etc. Some of these states correspond to a node being unresponsive to FCs requests. When a node goes
unresponsive for more than a set threshold, FC intervenes and reboots the node. We minimized the
downtime caused by the intervention threshold when a node switches to the Unhealthy state by fitting
various heavy-tail probability distributions. We consider using features of the node to customize
the organic recovery model to the individual nodes that go unhealthy. This regression approach
allows us to use information about the node like hardware, software versions, historical performance
indicators, etc. to inform the organic recovery model and hence the optimal threshold. In another
direction, we consider generalizing this to an arbitrary number of thresholds within the node state
machine (or Markov chain). When the states become intertwined in ways that different thresholds
start affecting each other, we can't simply optimize each of them in isolation. For best results,
we must consider this as an optimization problem in many variables (the number of thresholds). We
no longer have a nice closed form solution for this more complex problem like we did with one threshold,
but we can still use numerical techniques (gradient descent) to solve it.
