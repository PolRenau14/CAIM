We study the local geometry of testing a mean vector within a high-dimensional ellipse against a
compound alternative. Given samples of a Gaussian random vector, the goal is to distinguish whether
the mean is equal to a known vector within an ellipse, or equal to some other unknown vector in the ellipse.
Such ellipse testing problems lie at the heart of several applications, including non-parametric
goodness-of-fit testing, signal detection in cognitive radio, and regression function testing
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. While past work on such problems has focused on the difficulty
in a global sense, we study difficulty in a way that is localized to each vector within the ellipse.
Our main result is to give sharp upper and lower bounds on the localized minimax testing radius in
terms of an explicit formula involving the Kolmogorov width of the ellipse intersected with a Euclidean
ball. When applied to particular examples, our general theorems yield interesting rates that were
not known before: as a particular case, for testing in Sobolev ellipses of smoothness $\alpha$,
we demonstrate rates that vary from $(\sigma^2)^{\frac{4 \alpha}{4 \alpha + 1}}$, corresponding
to the classical global rate, to the faster rate $(\sigma^2)^{\frac{8 \alpha}{8 \alpha + 1}}$,
achievable for vectors at favorable locations within the ellipse. We also show that the optimal
test for this problem is achieved by a linear projection test that is based on an explicit lower-dimensional
projection of the observation vector.
