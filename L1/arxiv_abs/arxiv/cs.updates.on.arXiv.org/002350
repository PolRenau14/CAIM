This paper investigates two strategies to reduce the communication delay in future wireless networks:
traffic dispersion and network densification. A hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies
is also considered. The probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance.
For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the probability that the delay
exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in terms of upper bounds, which are derived by
applying stochastic network calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable
arrival traffic for mmWave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service capability with
a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The derived bounds on the probabilistic
delay and effective capacity are validated through simulations. These numerical results show
that, for a given average system gain, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid
scheme exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For instance,
traffic dispersion outperforms network densification, given high average system gain and arrival
rate, while it could be the worst option, otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing
the number of independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the performance
gain is related to the arrival rate and average system gain, jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission
scheme should be selected to optimize the delay performance, according to the given conditions
on arrival traffic and system service capability.
