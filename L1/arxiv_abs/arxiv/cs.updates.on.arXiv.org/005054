The use of social media affects the real world as well. This study relies on specific social network
measures to investigate the interactions between election participants and the importance of
their contacts. It investigates whether personal contacts matter more than know-how contacts
in wiki election nominations and voting participation by using standard tools such as Pajek and
Gephi. It further evaluates the significance of a personal contacts in online wiki elections through
a number of different graph-based influence identification methods. Additionally, the basic
characteristics and cohesive groups in the wiki vote network are explored. This work contributes
by discovering the significance of personal contacts over know-how contacts of a person in online
elections. It is found that personal contacts, i.e. immediate neighbors (degree centrality) and
neighborhood (k-neighbors) of a person have a positive effect on a person's nomination as an administrator
and also contribute to the active participation of voters in voting. Moreover, know-how contacts,
analyzed by means of measures such as betweenness and closeness centralities, have a relatively
insignificant effect on the selection of a person. However, know-how contacts in terms of betweenness
centrality for passing information in the network can positively contribute only to the voting
process. These contacts also measured in terms of influence domain and PageRank can play a vital
role in the selection of an admin. Additionally, such contacts in terms of reachability and brokerage
roles have a positive association with the voting process.
