Enabling large-scale energy-efficient Internet-of-things (IoT) connectivity is an essential
step towards realization of networked society. While legacy wide-area wireless systems are highly
dependent on network-side coordination, the level of consumed energy in signaling, as well as the
expected increase in the number of IoT devices, makes such centralized approaches infeasible in
future. Here, we address this problem by self-coordination for IoT networks through learning from
past communications. To this end, we first study low-complexity distributed learning approaches
applicable in IoT communications. Then, we present a learning solution to adapt communication
parameters of devices to the environment for maximizing energy efficiency and reliability in data
transmissions. Furthermore, leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, we evaluate the performance
of proposed distributed learning solution against the centralized coordination. Finally, we
analyze the interplay amongst energy efficiency, reliability of communications against noise
and interference over data channel, and reliability against adversarial interference over data
and feedback channels. The simulation results indicate that compared to the state of the art approaches,
both energy efficiency and reliability in IoT communications could be significantly improved
using the proposed learning approach. These promising results, which are achieved using lightweight
learning, make our solution favorable in many low-cost low-power IoT applications.
