A few works address the challenge of automating software diversification, and they all share one
core idea: using automated test suites to drive diversification. However, there is is lack of solid
understanding of how test suites, programs and transformations interact one with another in this
process. We explore this intricate interplay in the context of a specific diversification technique
called "sosiefication". Sosiefication generates sosie programs, i.e., variants of a program
in which some statements are deleted, added or replaced but still pass the test suite of the original
program. Our investigation of the influence of test suites on sosiefication exploits the following
observation: test suites cover the different regions of programs in very unequal ways. Hence, we
hypothesize that sosie synthesis has different performances on a statement that is covered by one
hundred test case and on a statement that is covered by a single test case. We synthesize 24583 sosies
on 6 popular open-source Java programs. Our results show that there are two dimensions for diversification.
The first one lies in the specification: the more test cases cover a statement, the more difficult
it is to synthesize sosies. Yet, to our surprise, we are also able to synthesize sosies on highly tested
statements (up to 600 test cases), which indicates an intrinsic property of the programs we study.
The second dimension is in the code: we manually explore dozens of sosies and characterize new types
of forgiving code regions that are prone to diversification.
