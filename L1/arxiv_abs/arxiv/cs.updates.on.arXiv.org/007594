As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question of when they surpass
state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational task is attracting
much attention. The leading candidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output
distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation
tool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or proprietary hardware.
We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for computational speedups, so as to match the
fidelity of a given quantum computer --- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive
speedups for the sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as well
as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing,
we price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate
approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one
million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5%, at an estimated cost of $35184. The simulation
costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate that extending circuit depth
to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million dollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities
needed for sampling 1M bitstrings helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We describe
refinements in benchmarks that slow down leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can
be simulated within the same time.
