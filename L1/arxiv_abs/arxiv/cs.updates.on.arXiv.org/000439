With the development of decision systems and specially data warehouses, the visibility of the data
warehouse design before its creation has become essential, and that because of data warehouse importance
as considered as the unique data source giving meaning to the decision. In a decision system the proper
functioning of a data warehouse resides in the smooth running of the middleware tools ETC step one
hand, and the restitution step through the data mining, reporting solutions, dashboards... etc
other. The large volume of data that passes through these stages require an optimal design for a highly
efficient decision system, without disregarding the choice of technologies that are introduced
for the data warehouse implementation such as: database management system, the type of server operating
systems, physical server architecture (64-bit, for example) that can be a benefit performance
of this system. The designer of the data warehouse should consider the effectiveness of data query,
this depends on the selection of relevant indexes and their combination with the materialized views,
note that the index selection is a NPcomplete problem, because the number of indexes is exponential
in the total number of attributes in the database, So, it is necessary to provide, while the data warehouse
design, the suitable type of index for this data warehouse. This paper presents a comparative study
between the index B-tree type and type Bitmap, their advantages and disadvantages, with a real experiment
showing that its index of type Bitmap more advantageous than the index B-tree type.
