An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a medical device used for the detection of potentially
fatal cardiac arrhythmia and their treatment through the delivery of electrical shocks intended
to restore normal heart rhythm. An ICD reprogramming attack seeks to alter the device's parameters
to induce unnecessary shocks and, even more egregious, prevent required therapy. In this paper,
we present a formal approach for the synthesis of ICD reprogramming attacks that are both effective,
i.e., lead to fundamental changes in the required therapy, and stealthy, i.e., involve minimal
changes to the nominal ICD parameters. We focus on the discrimination algorithm underlying Boston
Scientific devices (one of the principal ICD manufacturers) and formulate the synthesis problem
as one of multi-objective optimization. Our solution technique is based on an Optimization Modulo
Theories encoding of the problem and allows us to derive device parameters that are optimal with
respect to the effectiveness-stealthiness tradeoff (i.e., lie along the corresponding Pareto
front). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to derive systematic ICD reprogramming
attacks designed to maximize therapy disruption while minimizing detection. To evaluate our technique,
we employ an extensive dataset of synthetic EGMs (cardiac signals), each generated with a prescribed
arrhythmia, allowing us to synthesize attacks tailored to the victim's cardiac condition. Our
approach readily generalizes to unseen signals, representing the unknown EGM of the victim patient.
