Semidefinite programming can be considered over any real closed field, including fields of Puiseux
series equipped with their nonarchimedean valuation. Nonarchimedean semidefinite programs
encode parametric families of classical semidefinite programs, for sufficiently large values
of the parameter. Recently, a correspondence has been established between nonarchimedean semidefinite
programs and stochastic mean payoff games with perfect information. This correspondence relies
on tropical geometry. It allows one to solve generic nonarchimedean semidefinite feasibility
problems, of large scale, by means of stochastic game algorithms. In this paper, we show that the
mean payoff of these games can be interpreted as a condition number for the corresponding nonarchimedean
feasibility problems. This number measures how close a feasible instance is from being infeasible,
and vice versa. We show that it coincides with the maximal radius of a ball in Hilbert's projective
metric, that is included in the feasible set. The geometric interpretation of the condition number
relies in particular on a duality theorem for tropical semidefinite feasibility programs. Then,
we bound the complexity of the feasibility problem in terms of the condition number. We finally give
explicit bounds for this condition number, in terms of the characteristics of the stochastic game.
As a consequence, we show that the simplest algorithm to decide whether a stochastic mean payoff
game is winning, namely value iteration, has a pseudopolynomial complexity when the number of random
positions is fixed.
