Predicting the outcomes of integrating Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace
System (NAS) is a complex problem which is required to be addressed by simulation studies before
allowing the routine access of UAS into the NAS. This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional
(3D) simulation framework using a game theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts
using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, human
pilot interactive decision making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill
the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed
human pilot behavior is modeled using dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement
learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption
that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional "static" approach, each
agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On
the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents
and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate
reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers.
An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an example 3D scenario in the presence of manned
aircraft and fully autonomous UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.
