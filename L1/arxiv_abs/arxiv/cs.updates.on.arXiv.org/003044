Although the ADS-B system is going to play a major role in the safe navigation of airplanes and air
traffic control (ATC) management, it is also well known for its lack of security mechanisms. Previous
research has proposed various methods for improving the security of the ADS-B system and mitigating
associated risks. However, these solutions typically require the use of additional participating
nodes (or sensors) (e.g., to verify the location of the airplane by analyzing the physical signal)
or modification of the current protocol architecture (e.g., adding encryption or authentication
mechanisms.) Due to the regulation process regarding avionic systems and the fact that the ADS-B
system is already deployed in most airplanes, applying such modifications to the current protocol
at this stage is impractical. In this paper we propose an alternative security solution for detecting
anomalous ADS-B messages aimed at the detection of spoofed or manipulated ADS- B messages sent by
an attacker or compromised airplane. The proposed approach utilizes an LSTM encoder-decoder algorithm
for modeling flight routes by analyzing sequences of legitimate ADS-B messages. Using these models,
aircraft can autonomously evaluate received ADS-B messages and identify deviations from the legitimate
flight path (i.e., anomalies). We examined our approach on six different flight route datasets
to which we injected different types of anomalies. Using our approach we were able to detect all of
the injected attacks with an average false alarm rate of 4.3% for all of datasets.
