The first-ever Ukraine cyberattack on power grid has proven its devastation by hacking into their
critical cyber assets. With administrative privileges accessing substation networks/local
control centers, one intelligent way of coordinated cyberattacks is to execute a series of disruptive
switching executions on multiple substations using compromised supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems. These actions can cause significant impacts to an interconnected
power grid. Unlike the previous power blackouts, such high-impact initiating events can aggravate
operating conditions, initiating instability that may lead to system-wide cascading failure.
A systemic evaluation of "nightmare" scenarios is highly desirable for asset owners to manage and
prioritize the maintenance and investment in protecting their cyberinfrastructure. This survey
paper is a conceptual expansion of real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, impact analyses,
and mitigation (RAIM) framework that emphasizes on the resulting impacts, both on steady-state
and dynamic aspects of power system stability. Hypothetically, we associate the combinatorial
analyses of steady state on substations/components outages and dynamics of the sequential switching
orders as part of the permutation. The expanded framework includes (1) critical/noncritical combination
verification, (2) cascade confirmation, and (3) combination re-evaluation. This paper ends with
a discussion of the open issues for metrics and future design pertaining the impact quantification
of cyber-related contingencies.
