3D content creation is referred to as one of the most fundamental tasks of computer graphics. And
many 3D modeling algorithms from 2D images or curves have been developed over the past several decades.
Designers are allowed to align some conceptual images or sketch some suggestive curves, from front,
side, and top views, and then use them as references in constructing a 3D model automatically or manually.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated on 3D human body reconstruction
in a similar manner. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based reconstruction of 3D human body
shape from 2D orthographic views. A novel CNN-based regression network, with two branches corresponding
to frontal and lateral views respectively, is designed for estimating 3D human body shape from 2D
mask images. We train our networks separately to decouple the feature descriptors which encode
the body parameters from different views, and fuse them to estimate an accurate human body shape.
In addition, to overcome the shortage of training data required for this purpose, we propose some
significantly data augmentation schemes for 3D human body shapes, which can be used to promote further
research on this topic. Extensive experimen- tal results demonstrate that visually realistic
and accurate reconstructions can be achieved effectively using our algorithm. Requiring only
binary mask images, our method can help users create their own digital avatars quickly, and also
make it easy to create digital human body for 3D game, virtual reality, online fashion shopping.
