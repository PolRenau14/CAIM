A growing number of visual computing applications depend on the analysis of large video collections.
The challenge is that scaling applications to operate on these datasets requires efficient systems
for pixel data access and parallel processing across large numbers of machines. Few programmers
have the capability to operate efficiently at these scales, limiting the field's ability to explore
new applications that leverage big video data. In response, we have created Scanner, a system for
productive and efficient video analysis at scale. Scanner organizes video collections as tables
in a data store optimized for sampling frames from compressed video, and executes pixel processing
computations, expressed as dataflow graphs, on these frames. Scanner schedules video analysis
applications expressed using these abstractions onto heterogeneous throughput computing hardware,
such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and media processing ASICs, for high-throughput pixel processing.
We demonstrate the productivity of Scanner by authoring a variety of video processing applications
including the synthesis of stereo VR video streams from multi-camera rigs, markerless 3D human
pose reconstruction from video, and data-mining big video datasets such as hundreds of feature-length
films or over 70,000 hours of TV news. These applications achieve near-expert performance on a single
machine and scale efficiently to hundreds of machines, enabling formerly long-running big video
data analysis tasks to be carried out in minutes to hours.
