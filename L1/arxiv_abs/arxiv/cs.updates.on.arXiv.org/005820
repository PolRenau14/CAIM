In recent years, data-driven methods have shown great success for extracting information about
the infrastructure in urban areas. These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting
of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. While large datasets have been published
regarding cars, for cyclists very few labeled data is available although appearance, point of view,
and positioning of even relevant objects differ. Unfortunately, labeling data is costly and requires
a huge amount of work. In this paper, we thus address the problem of learning with very few labels.
The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which
is of interest to cyclists. We propose a system for object recognition that is trained with only 15
examples per class on average. To achieve this, we combine the advantages of convolutional neural
networks and random forests to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, we map the random
forest to a neural network and transform the classifier to a fully convolutional network. Thereby,
the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted.
Finally, we integrate data of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to localize the predictions on
the map. In comparison to Faster R-CNN and other networks for object recognition or algorithms for
transfer learning, we considerably reduce the required amount of labeled data. We demonstrate
good performance on the recognition of traffic signs for cyclists as well as their localization
in maps.
