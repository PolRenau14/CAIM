Time-sync comments reveal a new way of extracting the online video tags. However, such time-sync
comments have lots of noises due to users' diverse comments, introducing great challenges for accurate
and fast video tag extractions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised video tag extraction algorithm
named Semantic Weight-Inverse Document Frequency (SW-IDF). Specifically, we first generate
corresponding semantic association graph (SAG) using semantic similarities and timestamps of
the time-sync comments. Second, we propose two graph cluster algorithms, i.e., dialogue-based
algorithm and topic center-based algorithm, to deal with the videos with different density of comments.
Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to each comment based on the degrees
of the clustered subgraphs, which can differentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally,
we gain the weight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document Frequency
(IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an unsupervised way. Extensive
experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based algorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932
MAP (Mean Average Precision) in high-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density
comments; while SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122 MAP
in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density comments. It has a better
performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms in both F1-score and MAP.
