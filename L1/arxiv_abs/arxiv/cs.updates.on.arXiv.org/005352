We consider a system, containing a library of multiple files and a general memoryless communication
network through which a server is connected to multiple users, each equipped with a local isolated
cache of certain size that can be used to store part of the library. Each user will ask for one of the
files in the library, which needs to be delivered by the server through the intermediate communication
network. The objective is to design the cache placement (without prior knowledge of users' future
requests) and the delivery phase in order to minimize the (normalized) delivery delay. We assume
that the delivery phase consists of two steps: (1) generation of a set of multicast messages at the
server, one for each subset of users, and (2) delivery of the multicast messages to the users. In this
setting, we show that there exists a universal scheme for cache placement and multicast message
generation, which is independent of the underlying communication network between the server and
the users, and achieves the optimal delivery delay to within a constant factor for all memoryless
networks. We prove this result, even though the capacity region of the underlying communication
network is not known, even approximately. This result demonstrates that in the aforementioned
setting, a separation between caching and multicast message generation on one hand, and delivering
the multicast messages to the users on the other hand is approximately optimal. This result has the
important practical implication that the prefetching can be done independent of network structure
in the upcoming delivery phase.
