We introduce CASED, a novel curriculum sampling algorithm that facilitates the optimization of
deep learning segmentation or detection models on data sets with extreme class imbalance. We evaluate
the CASED learning framework on the task of lung nodule detection in chest CT. In contrast to two-stage
solutions, wherein nodule candidates are first proposed by a segmentation model and refined by
a second detection stage, CASED improves the training of deep nodule segmentation models (e.g.
UNet) to the point where state of the art results are achieved using only a trivial detection stage.
CASED improves the optimization of deep segmentation models by allowing them to first learn how
to distinguish nodules from their immediate surroundings, while continuously adding a greater
proportion of difficult-to-classify global context, until uniformly sampling from the empirical
data distribution. Using CASED during training yields a minimalist proposal to the lung nodule
detection problem that tops the LUNA16 nodule detection benchmark with an average sensitivity
score of 88.35%. Furthermore, we find that models trained using CASED are robust to nodule annotation
quality by showing that comparable results can be achieved when only a point and radius for each ground
truth nodule are provided during training. Finally, the CASED learning framework makes no assumptions
with regard to imaging modality or segmentation target and should generalize to other medical imaging
problems where class imbalance is a persistent problem.
