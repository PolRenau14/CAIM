Complex event processing (CEP) is widely employed to detect occurrences of predefined combinations
(patterns) of events in massive data streams. As new events are accepted, they are matched using
some type of evaluation structure, commonly optimized according to the statistical properties
of the data items in the input stream. However, in many real-life scenarios the data characteristics
are never known in advance or are subject to frequent on-the-fly changes. To modify the evaluation
structure as a reaction to such changes, adaptation mechanisms are employed. These mechanisms
typically function by monitoring a set of properties and applying a new evaluation plan when significant
deviation from the initial values is observed. This strategy often leads to missing important input
changes or it may incur substantial computational overhead by over-adapting. In this paper, we
present an efficient and precise method for dynamically deciding whether and how the evaluation
structure should be reoptimized. This method is based on a small set of constraints to be satisfied
by the monitored values, defined such that a better evaluation plan is guaranteed if any of the constraints
is violated. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed mechanism is the first to provably avoid false
positives on reoptimization decisions. We formally prove this claim and demonstrate how our method
can be applied on known algorithms for evaluation plan generation. Our extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets confirms the superiority of our strategy over existing methods
in terms of performance and accuracy.
