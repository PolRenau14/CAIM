Predicting transportation modes from GPS (Global Positioning System) records is a hot topic in
the trajectory mining domain. Each GPS record is called a trajectory point and a trajectory is a sequence
of these points. Trajectory mining has applications including but not limited to transportation
mode detection, tourism, traffic congestion, smart cities management, animal behaviour analysis,
environmental preservation, and traffic dynamics are some of the trajectory mining applications.
Transportation modes prediction as one of the tasks in human mobility and vehicle mobility applications
plays an important role in resource allocation, traffic management systems, tourism planning
and accident detection. In this work, the proposed framework in Etemad et al. is extended to consider
other aspects in the task of transportation modes prediction. Wrapper search and information retrieval
methods were investigated to find the best subset of trajectory features. Finding the best classifier
and the best feature subset, the framework is compared against two related papers that applied deep
learning methods. The results show that our framework achieved better performance. Moreover,
the ground truth noise removal improved accuracy of transportation modes prediction task; however,
the assumption of having access to test set labels in pre-processing task is invalid. Furthermore,
the cross validation approaches were investigated and the performance results show that the random
cross validation method provides optimistic results.
