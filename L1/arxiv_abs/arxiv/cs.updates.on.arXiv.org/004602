Multi- or many-objective evolutionary algorithm- s(MOEAs), especially the decomposition-based
MOEAs have been widely concerned in recent years. The decomposition-based MOEAs emphasize convergence
and diversity in a simple model and have made a great success in dealing with theoretical and practical
multi- or many-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on update strategies of
the decomposition- based MOEAs, and their criteria for comparing solutions. Three disadvantages
of the decomposition-based MOEAs with local update strategies and several existing criteria for
comparing solutions are analyzed and discussed. And a global loop update strategy and two hybrid
criteria are suggested. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm with the global loop update is
implement- ed and compared to several of the best multi- or many-objective optimization algorithms
on two famous unconstraint test suites with up to 15 objectives. Experimental results demonstrate
that unlike evolutionary algorithms with local update strategies, the population of our algorithm
does not degenerate at any generation of its evolution, which guarantees the diversity of the resulting
population. In addition, our algorithm wins in most instances of the two test suites, indicating
that it is very compet- itive in terms of convergence and diversity. Running results of our algorithm
with different criteria for comparing solutions are also compared. Their differences are very
significant, indicating that the performance of our algorithm is affected by the criterion it adopts.
