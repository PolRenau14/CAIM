In this paper, a novel joint transmit power and resource allocation approach for enabling ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks is proposed. The objective is to minimize
the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) while ensuring high reliability
in terms of probabilistic queuing delays. In particular, a reliability measure is defined to characterize
extreme events (i.e., when vehicles' queue lengths exceed a predefined threshold with non-negligible
probability) using extreme value theory (EVT). Leveraging principles from federated learning
(FL), the distribution of these extreme events corresponding to the tail distribution of queues
is estimated by VUEs in a decentralized manner. Finally, Lyapunov optimization is used to find the
joint transmit power and resource allocation policies for each VUE in a distributed manner. The
proposed solution is validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. It
is shown that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues
with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized solution with up to 79\% reductions in the amount
of data that need to be exchanged. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60\% reductions
of VUEs with large queue lengths, without an additional power consumption, compared to an average
queue-based baseline. Compared to systems with fixed power consumption and focusing on queue stability
while minimizing average power consumption, the reduction in extreme events of the proposed method
is about two orders of magnitude.
