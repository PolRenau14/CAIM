As an important application in the busy world today, mobile video conferencing facilitates virtual
face-to-face communication with friends, families and colleagues, via their mobile devices on
the move. However, how to provision high-quality, multi-party video conferencing experiences
over mobile devices is still an open challenge. The fundamental reason behind is the lack of computation
and communication capacities on the mobile devices, to scale to large conferencing sessions. In
this paper, we present vSkyConf, a cloud-assisted mobile video conferencing system to fundamentally
improve the quality and scale of multi-party mobile video conferencing. By novelly employing a
surrogate virtual machine in the cloud for each mobile user, we allow fully scalable communication
among the conference participants via their surrogates, rather than directly. The surrogates
exchange conferencing streams among each other, transcode the streams to the most appropriate
bit rates, and buffer the streams for the most efficient delivery to the mobile recipients. A fully
decentralized, optimal algorithm is designed to decide the best paths of streams and the most suitable
surrogates for video transcoding along the paths, such that the limited bandwidth is fully utilized
to deliver streams of the highest possible quality to the mobile recipients. We also carefully tailor
a buffering mechanism on each surrogate to cooperate with optimal stream distribution. We have
implemented vSkyConf based on Amazon EC2 and verified the excellent performance of our design,
as compared to the widely adopted unicast solutions.
