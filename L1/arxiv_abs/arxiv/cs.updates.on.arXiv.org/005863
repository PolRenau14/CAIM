In this paper, we train a recurrent neural network to learn dynamics of a chaotic road environment
and to project the future of the environment on an image. Future projection can be used to anticipate
an unseen environment for example, in autonomous driving. Road environment is highly dynamic and
complex due to the interaction among traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians. Even
in this complex environment, a human driver is efficacious to safely drive on chaotic roads irrespective
of the number of traffic participants. The proliferation of deep learning research has shown the
efficacy of neural networks in learning this human behavior. In the same direction, we investigate
recurrent neural networks to understand the chaotic road environment which is shared by pedestrians,
vehicles (cars, trucks, bicycles etc.), and sometimes animals as well. We propose \emph{Foresee},
a unidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) network with attention to project future of the environment
in the form of images. We have collected several videos on Delhi roads consisting of various traffic
participants, background and infrastructure differences (like 3D pedestrian crossing) at various
times on various days. We train \emph{Foresee} in an unsupervised way and we use online training
to project frames up to $0.5$ seconds in advance. We show that our proposed model performs better
than state of the art methods (prednet and Enc. Dec. LSTM) and finally, we show that our trained model
generalizes to a public dataset for future projections.
