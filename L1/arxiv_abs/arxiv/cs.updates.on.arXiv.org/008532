The paper is devoted to the development of a methodology for evaluating the scalability of compute-intensive
iterative algorithms used in simulating complex physical processes on supercomputer systems.
The proposed methodology is based on the BSF (Bulk Synchronous Farm) parallel computation model,
which makes it possible to predict the upper scalability bound of an iterative algorithm in early
phases of its design. The BSF model assumes the representation of the algorithm in the form of operations
on lists using high-order functions. Two classes of representations are considered: BSF-M (Map
BSF) and BSF-MR (Map-Reduce BSF). The proposed methodology is described by the example of the solution
of the system of linear equations by the Jacobi method. For the Jacobi method, two iterative algorithms
are constructed: Jacobi-M based on the BSF-M representation and Jacobi-MR based on the BSF-MR representation.
Analytical estimations of the speedup, parallel efficiency and upper scalability bound are constructed
for these algorithms using the BSF cost metrics on multiprocessor computing systems with distributed
memory. An information about the implementation of these algorithms in C++ language using the BSF
program skeleton and MPI parallel programming library are given. The results of large-scale computational
experiments performed on a cluster computing system are demonstrated. Based on the experimental
results, an analysis of the adequacy of estimations obtained analytically by using the cost metrics
of the BSF model is made.
