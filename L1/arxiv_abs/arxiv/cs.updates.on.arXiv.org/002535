Tracking movement of mobile nodes has received significant scientific and commercial interest,
but long term tracking of resource-constrained mobile nodes remains challenging due to the high
energy consumption of satellite receivers. Cooperative position tracking has been proposed for
energy efficiency, however, all the cooperative schemes use opportunistic cooperation and optimize
for either energy or accuracy. Considering the existence of a reasonably stable group of mobile
nodes like animals, birds, and mobile assets, we propose a cluster-based cooperative tracking
algorithm, where cluster head centrally coordinates resource usage among cluster members. Variants
of this strategy include the use of a cooperative Kalman filter with and without inertial sensor
inputs to estimate nodes positions. We use the Boid flocking algorithm to generate group position
movements in 3D and perform various experiments to compare the energy and position accuracy tradeoff
of our proposed scheme with individual-based tracking and existing cooperative schemes. We perform
the experiments for fixed periodic GPS sampling and dynamic GPS sampling triggered by node position
error uncertainty tolerance limit. Experiments results show that in periodic sampling scheme
cooperative tracking yields more than one-quarter reduction in energy consumption and more than
one-third improvement in position accuracy over individual-based tracking, however, results
for dynamic sampling scheme are comparable with existing cooperative scheme.
