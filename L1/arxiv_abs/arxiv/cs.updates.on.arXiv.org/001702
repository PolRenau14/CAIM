Network coding based peer-to-peer streaming represents an effective solution to aggregate user
capacities and to increase system throughput in live multimedia streaming. Nonetheless, such
systems are vulnerable to pollution attacks where a handful of malicious peers can disrupt the communication
by transmitting just a few bogus packets which are then recombined and relayed by unaware honest
nodes, further spreading the pollution over the network. Whereas previous research focused on
malicious nodes identification schemes and pollution-resilient coding, in this paper we show
pollution countermeasures which make a standard network coding scheme resilient to pollution
attacks. Thanks to a simple yet effective analytical model of a reference node collecting packets
by malicious and honest neighbors, we demonstrate that i) packets received earlier are less likely
to be polluted and ii) short generations increase the likelihood to recover a clean generation.
Therefore, we propose a recombination scheme where nodes draw packets to be recombined according
to their age in the input queue, paired with a decoding scheme able to detect the reception of polluted
packets early in the decoding process and short generations. The effectiveness of our approach
is experimentally evaluated in a real system we developed and deployed on hundreds to thousands
peers. Experimental evidence shows that, thanks to our simple countermeasures, the effect of a
pollution attack is almost canceled and the video quality experienced by the peers is comparable
to pre-attack levels.
