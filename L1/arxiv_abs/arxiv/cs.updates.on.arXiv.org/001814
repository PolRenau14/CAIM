Non-invasive detection of cardiovascular disorders from radiology scans requires quantitative
image analysis of the heart and its substructures. There are well-established measurements that
radiologists use for diseases assessment such as ejection fraction, volume of four chambers, and
myocardium mass. These measurements are derived as outcomes of precise segmentation of the heart
and its substructures. The aim of this paper is to provide such measurements through an accurate
image segmentation algorithm that automatically delineates seven substructures of the heart
from MRI and/or CT scans. Our proposed method is based on multi-planar deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN) with an adaptive fusion strategy where we automatically utilize complementary
information from different planes of the 3D scans for improved delineations. For CT and MRI, we have
separately designed three CNNs (the same architectural configuration) for three planes, and have
trained the networks from scratch for voxel-wise labeling for the following cardiac structures:
myocardium of left ventricle (Myo), left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), right atrium (RA), right
ventricle (RV), ascending aorta (Ao), and main pulmonary artery (PA). We have evaluated the proposed
method with 4-fold-cross validation on the multi-modality whole heart segmentation challenge
(MM-WHS 2017) dataset. The precision and dice index of 0.93 and 0.90, and 0.87 and 0.85 were achieved
for CT and MR images, respectively. While a CT volume was segmented about 50 seconds, an MRI scan was
segmented around 17 seconds with the GPUs/CUDA implementation.
