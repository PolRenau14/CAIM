Conventional Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) systems suffer from the following major drawback:
Privacy policies that define what constitutes data leakage cannot be seamlessly defined and enforced
across heterogeneous forms of communication. Administrators have the dual burden of: (1) manually
self-interpreting policies from handbooks to specify rules (which is error-prone); (2) extracting
relevant information flows from heterogeneous communication protocols and enforcing policies
to determine which flows should be admissible. To address these issues, we present the Verifiable
and ACtionable Contextual Integrity Norms Engine (VACCINE), a framework for building adaptable
and modular DLP systems. VACCINE relies on (1) the theory of contextual integrity to provide an abstraction
layer suitable for specifying reusable protocol-agnostic leakage prevention rules and (2) programming
language techniques to check these rules against correctness properties and to enforce them faithfully
within a DLP system implementation. We applied VACCINE to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act and Enron Corporation privacy regulations. We show that by using contextual integrity in conjunction
with verification techniques, we can effectively create reusable privacy rules with specific
correctness guarantees, and check the integrity of information flows against these rules. Our
experiments in emulated enterprise settings indicate that VACCINE improves over current DLP system
design approaches and can be deployed in enterprises involving tens of thousands of actors.
