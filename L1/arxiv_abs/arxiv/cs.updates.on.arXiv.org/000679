Millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz are a new frontier for cellular communication
that offers the promise of orders of magnitude greater bandwidths combined with further gains via
beamforming and spatial multiplexing from multi-element antenna arrays. This paper surveys measurements
and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell deployments in urban environments.
The conclusions are extremely encouraging; measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate
that, even in an urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor, street-level
coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential low power micro- or picocell base
station. In addition, based on statistical channel models from these measurements, it is shown
that mmW systems can offer more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art
4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular systems, however, will need to be significantly
redesigned to fully achieve these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional
and adaptive transmissions, directional isolation between links and significant possibilities
of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel structure, synchronization and
receiver design. To address these challenges, the paper discusses how various technologies including
adaptive beamforming, multihop relaying, heterogeneous network architectures and carrier aggregation
can be leveraged in the mmW context.
