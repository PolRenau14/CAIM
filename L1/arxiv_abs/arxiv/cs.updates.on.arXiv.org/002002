Optical communication systems represent the backbone of modern communication networks. Since
their deployment, different fiber technologies have been used to deal with optical fiber impairments
such as dispersion-shifted fibers and dispersion-compensation fibers. In recent years, thanks
to the introduction of coherent detection based systems, fiber impairments can be mitigated using
digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. Coherent systems are used in the current 100 Gbps wavelength-division
multiplexing (WDM) standard technology. They allow the increase of spectral efficiency by using
multi-level modulation formats, and are combined with DSP techniques to combat the linear fiber
distortions. In addition to linear impairments, the next generation 400 Gbps/1 Tbps WDM systems
are also more affected by the fiber nonlinearity due to the Kerr effect. At high input power, the fiber
nonlinear effects become more important and their compensation is required to improve the transmission
performance. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the fiber nonlinearity. In this
paper, after a brief description of the Kerr-induced nonlinear effects, a survey on the fiber nonlinearity
compensation (NLC) techniques is provided. We focus on the well-known NLC techniques and discuss
their performance, as well as their implementation and complexity. An extension of the inter-subcarrier
nonlinear interference canceler approach is also proposed. A performance evaluation of the well-known
NLC techniques and the proposed approach is provided in the context of Nyquist and super-Nyquist
superchannel systems.
