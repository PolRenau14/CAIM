Load balancing is a common approach in web server farms or inventory routing problems. An important
issue in such systems is to determine the server to which an incoming request should be routed to optimize
a given performance criteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be
heterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline which belongs to the
class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling disciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$
jobs can be served simultaneously, and hence, includes as special cases First Come First Served
($d=1$) and Processor Sharing ($d=\infty$). In order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model
the above load-balancing framework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation
technique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive Whittle's index policy for
general cost functions and obtain a closed-form expression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state
distribution. Through numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's index
with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost criterion that depends
on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our results show that \emph{(i)} the structure
of Whittle's index policy can strongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server,
i.e., on $d$, and that \emph{(ii)} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms standard
dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the Shortest Expected Workload (JSEW),
and Random Server allocation (RSA).
