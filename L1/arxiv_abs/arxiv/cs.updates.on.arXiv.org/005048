We develop a method for the evaluation of extreme event statistics associated with nonlinear dynamical
systems, using a small number of samples. From an initial dataset of design points, we formulate
a sequential strategy that provides the 'next-best' data point (set of parameters) that when evaluated
results in improved estimates of the probability density function (pdf) for a scalar quantity of
interest. The approach utilizes Gaussian process regression to perform Bayesian inference on
the parameter-to-observation map describing the quantity of interest. We then approximate the
desired pdf along with uncertainty bounds utilizing the posterior distribution of the inferred
map. The 'next-best' design point is sequentially determined through an optimization procedure
that selects the point in parameter space that maximally reduces uncertainty between the estimated
bounds of the pdf prediction. Since the optimization process utilizes only information from the
inferred map it has minimal computational cost. Moreover, the special form of the metric emphasizes
the tails of the pdf. The method is practical for systems where the dimensionality of the parameter
space is of moderate size, i.e. order O(10). We apply the method to estimate the extreme event statistics
for a very high-dimensional system with millions of degrees of freedom: an offshore platform subjected
to three-dimensional irregular waves. It is demonstrated that the developed approach can accurately
determine the extreme event statistics using limited number of samples.
