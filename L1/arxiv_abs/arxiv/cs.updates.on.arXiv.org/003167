The recent advanced wireless energy harvesting technology has enabled wireless-powered communications
to accommodate wireless data services in a self-sustainable manner. However, wireless-powered
communications rely on active RF signals to communicate, and result in high power consumption.
On the other hand, ambient backscatter technology that passively reflects existing RF signal sources
in the air to communicate has the potential to facilitate an implementation with ultra-low power
consumption. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid D2D communication paradigm by integrating ambient
backscattering with wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are self-sustainable,
as no dedicated external power supply is required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting
and for backscattering come from the ambient, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications
depends largely on environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission
load of ambient energy sources. Therefore, we design two mode selection protocols for the hybrid
D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical
models to characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors on the hybrid D2D communication
performance. Together with extensive simulations, our analysis shows that the communication
performance benefits from larger repulsion, transmission load and density of ambient energy sources.
Further, we investigate how different mode selection mechanisms affect the communication performance.
