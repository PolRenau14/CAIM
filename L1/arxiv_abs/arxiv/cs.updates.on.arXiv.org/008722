Although Bitcoin was intended to be a decentralized digital currency, in practice, mining power
is quite concentrated. This fact is a persistent source of concern for the Bitcoin community. We
provide an explanation using a simple model to capture miners' incentives to invest in equipment.
In our model, $n$ miners compete for a prize of fixed size. Each miner chooses an investment $q_i$,
incurring cost $c_i q_i$, and then receives reward $\frac{q_i^\alpha}{\sum_j q_j^\alpha}$,
for some $\alpha \geq 1$. When $c_i = c_j$ for all $i,j$, and $\alpha = 1$, there is a unique equilibrium
where all miners invest equally. However, we prove that under seemingly mild deviations from this
model, equilibrium outcomes become drastically more centralized. In particular, (a) When costs
are asymmetric, if miner $i$ chooses to invest, then miner $j$ has market share at least $1-\frac{c_j}{c_i}$.
That is, if miner $j$ has costs that are (e.g.) $20\%$ lower than those of miner $i$, then miner $j$
must control at least $20\%$ of the \emph{total} mining power. (b) In the presence of economies of
scale ($\alpha > 1$), every market participant has a market share of at least $1-\frac{1}{\alpha}$,
implying that the market features at most $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha - 1}$ miners in total. We discuss
the implications of our results for the future design of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our work
further motivates the study of protocols that minimize "orphaned" blocks, proof-of-stake protocols,
and incentive compatible protocols.
