Achieving an increase in the spectral efficiency (SE) has always been a major driver in the design
of communication systems. The use of MIMO techniques in mobile communications has achieved significant
benefits in improving the system throughput. The basic underlying concept of MIMO is to exploit
the signal and channel characteristics to eliminate interference between multiple transmissions.
Departing from the work carried out under the industrial projects \cite{NGW,Henarejos}, we extend
the results provided in their respective reports. The goal is to increase the SE without an increment
of radiated energy without any Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) and feedback at
the transmitter and maintaining a very low computational complexity at the receiver. Although
a priori additional power is required to increase the SE, we demonstrate that the proposed Polarized
Modulation (PMod) scheme exploits the polarization diversity reducing the required EbN0 and adding
an extra bit. We also introduce two receivers to demodulate this scheme of different computational
complexities. We describe a Near Optimal Detector (NOD) which achieves almost the same performance
as the optimal detector based on the Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD), but with lower computational
complexity. Finally, the results demonstrate that the PMod requires less EbN0 compared with the
single polarization case, guarantees the robustness in the presence of the cross-polarization
and validates that PMod can multiplex two streams of different Quality of Service (QoS).
