Large scale digital computing almost exclusively relies on the von-Neumann architecture which
comprises of separate units for storage and computations. The energy expensive transfer of data
from the memory units to the computing cores results in the well-known von-Neumann bottleneck.
Various approaches aimed towards bypassing the von-Neumann bottleneck are being extensively
explored in the literature. Emerging non-volatile memristive technologies have been shown to
be very efficient in computing analog dot products in an in-situ fashion. The memristive analog
computation of the dot product results in much faster operation as opposed to digital vector in-memory
bit-wise Boolean computations. However, challenges with respect to large scale manufacturing
coupled with the limited endurance of memristors have hindered rapid commercialization of memristive
based computing solutions. In this work, we show that the standard 8 transistor (8T) digital SRAM
array can be configured as an analog-like in-memory multi-bit dot product engine. By applying appropriate
analog voltages to the read-ports of the 8T SRAM array, and sensing the output current, an approximate
analog-digital dot-product engine can be implemented. We present two different configurations
for enabling multi-bit dot product computations in the 8T SRAM cell array, without modifying the
standard bit-cell structure. Since our proposal preserves the standard 8T-SRAM array structure,
it can be used as a storage element with standard read-write instructions, and also as an on-demand
analog-like dot product accelerator.
