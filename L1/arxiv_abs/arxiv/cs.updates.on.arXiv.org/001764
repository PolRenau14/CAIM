In complex, high dimensional and unstructured data it is often difficult to extract meaningful
patterns. This is especially the case when dealing with textual data. Recent studies in machine
learning, information theory and network science have developed several novel instruments to
extract the semantics of unstructured data, and harness it to build a network of relations. Such
approaches serve as an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction and pattern detection. This
paper applies semantic network science to extract ideological proximity in the international
arena, by focusing on the data from General Debates in the UN General Assembly on the topics of high
salience to international community. UN General Debate corpus (UNGDC) covers all high-level debates
in the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2014, covering all UN member states. The research proceeds
in three main steps. First, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to extract the topics of the
UN speeches, and therefore semantic information. Each country is then assigned a vector specifying
the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate output is then used in to construct
a network of countries based on information theoretical metrics where the links capture similar
vectorial patterns in the topic distributions. Topology of the networks is then analyzed through
network properties like density, path length and clustering. Finally, we identify specific topological
features of our networks using the map equation framework to detect communities in our networks
of countries.
