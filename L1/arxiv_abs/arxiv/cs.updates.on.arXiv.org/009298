Context: The software industry needs to adapt itself to a rapidly changing market. Continuous practices
(Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment), commonly found in
Agile development processes, it is possible to deliver new features more frequently to clients,
integrating of smaller features is less likely to cause conflicts than the more traditional approach
of merging big features less frequently all at once. However, Continuous Deployment is no clear
way on the best approaches for their implementation. Objective: The goal of this paper is to identify
the challenges and the solutions related to Continuous Deployment, and then see which of those solutions
can be applied to which challenges. Method: This paper is a systematic literature review of the problems
and the solutions found when implementing the continuous deployment practice inside an organization.
It also presents which solution can be applied to which problem. Thirty-one articles published
after 2015 were analyzed for this SLR. Results: 22 problems were grouped inside the categories Human
and Organizational, Process, Tools, Infrastructure, Application Architecture and Testing.
The 19 solutions found were grouped inside the categories Human and Organizational, Architecture,
Process and Tools. Solutions have been found for 14 problems and some questions have been identified
for future research. Conclusion: this article is to serve as a reference for the practitioner who
wants to find how to solve a specific challenge when implementing the continuous deployment practice.
