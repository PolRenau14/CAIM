In statistical modelling the biggest threat is concept drift which makes the model gradually showing
deteriorating performance over time. There are state of the art methodologies to detect the impact
of concept drift, however general strategy considered to overcome the issue in performance is to
rebuild or re-calibrate the model periodically as the variable patterns for the model changes significantly
due to market change or consumer behavior change etc. Quantitative research is the most widely spread
application of data science in Marketing or financial domain where applicability of state of the
art reinforcement learning for auto-learning is less explored paradigm. Reinforcement learning
is heavily dependent on having a simulated environment which is majorly available for gaming or
online systems, to learn from the live feedback. However, there are some research happened on the
area of online advertisement, pricing etc where due to the nature of the online learning environment
scope of reinforcement learning is explored. Our proposed solution is a reinforcement learning
based, true self-learning algorithm which can adapt to the data change or concept drift and auto
learn and self-calibrate for the new patterns of the data solving the problem of concept drift. Keywords
