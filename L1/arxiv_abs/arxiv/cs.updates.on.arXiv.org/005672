Age estimation is a difficult task which requires the automatic detection and interpretation of
facial features. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable improvement
on learning age patterns from benchmark datasets. However, for a face "in the wild" (from a video
frame or Internet), the existing algorithms are not as accurate as for a frontal and neutral face.
In addition, with the increasing number of in-the-wild aging data, the computation speed of existing
deep learning platforms becomes another crucial issue. In this paper, we propose a high-efficient
age estimation system with joint optimization of age estimation algorithm and deep learning system.
Cooperated with the city surveillance network, this system can provide age group analysis for intelligent
demographics. First, we build a three-tier fog computing architecture including an edge, a fog
and a cloud layer, which directly processes age estimation from raw videos. Second, we optimize
the age estimation algorithm based on CNNs with label distribution and K-L divergence distance
embedded in the fog layer and evaluate the model on the latest wild aging dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that: 1. our system collects the demographics data dynamically at far-distance without
contact, and makes the city population analysis automatically; and 2. the age model training has
been speed-up without losing training progress or model quality. To our best knowledge, this is
the first intelligent demographics system which has potential applications in improving the efficiency
of smart cities and urban living.
