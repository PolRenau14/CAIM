Action anticipation, intent prediction, and proactive behavior are all desirable characteristics
for autonomous driving policies in interactive scenarios. Paramount, however, is ensuring safety
on the road --- a key challenge in doing so is accounting for uncertainty in human driver actions without
unduly impacting planner performance. This paper introduces a minimally-interventional safety
controller operating within an autonomous vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free
interaction with an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart. We leverage reachability
analysis to construct a real-time (100Hz) controller that serves the dual role of (1) tracking an
input trajectory from a higher-level planning algorithm using model predictive control, and (2)
assuring safety through maintaining the availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a
persistent constraint regardless of whatever future actions the other car takes. A full-scale
steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic weaving experiments wherein the two cars, initially
side-by-side, must swap lanes in a limited amount of time and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off
of a highway. We demonstrate that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid
collision even when the other car defies the planner's expectations and takes dangerous actions,
either carelessly or with the intent to collide, and otherwise deviates minimally from the planned
trajectory to the extent required to maintain safety.
