In this paper, we focus on fine-grained recognition of vehicles mainly in traffic surveillance
applications. We propose an approach that is orthogonal to recent advancements in fine-grained
recognition (automatic part discovery and bilinear pooling). In addition, in contrast to other
methods focused on fine-grained recognition of vehicles, we do not limit ourselves to a frontal/rear
viewpoint, but allow the vehicles to be seen from any viewpoint. Our approach is based on 3-D bounding
boxes built around the vehicles. The bounding box can be automatically constructed from traffic
surveillance data. For scenarios where it is not possible to use precise construction, we propose
a method for an estimation of the 3-D bounding box. The 3-D bounding box is used to normalize the image
viewpoint by "unpacking" the image into a plane. We also propose to randomly alter the color of the
image and add a rectangle with random noise to a random position in the image during the training of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We have collected a large fine-grained vehicle data set
BoxCars116k, with 116k images of vehicles from various viewpoints taken by numerous surveillance
cameras. We performed a number of experiments, which show that our proposed method significantly
improves CNN classification accuracy (the accuracy is increased by up to 12% points and the error
is reduced by up to 50% compared with CNNs without the proposed modifications). We also show that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for fine-grained recognition.
