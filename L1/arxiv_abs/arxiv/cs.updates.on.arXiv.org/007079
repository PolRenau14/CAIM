Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies are gaining momentum for internet-of-things
(IoT) applications since they promise wide coverage to a massive number of battery-operated devices
using grant-free medium access. LoRaWAN, with its physical (PHY) layer design and regulatory efforts,
has emerged as the widely adopted LPWAN solution. By using chirp spread spectrum modulation with
qausi-orthogonal spreading factors (SFs), LoRa PHY offers coverage to wide-area applications
while supporting high-density of devices. However, thus far its scalability performance has been
inadequately modeled and the effect of interference resulting from the imperfect orthogonality
of the SFs has not been considered. In this paper, we present an analytical model of a single-cell
LoRa system that accounts for the impact of interference among transmissions over the same SF (co-SF)
as well as different SFs (inter-SF). By modeling the interference field as Poisson point process
under duty-cycled ALOHA, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distributions for
several interference conditions. Results show that, for a duty cycle as low as 0.33%, the network
performance under co-SF interference alone is considerably optimistic as the inclusion of inter-SF
interference unveils a further drop in the success probability and the coverage probability of
approximately 10% and 15%, respectively for 1500 devices in a LoRa channel. Finally, we illustrate
how our analysis can characterize the critical device density with respect to cell size for a given
reliability target.
