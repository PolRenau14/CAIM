With the advent of the Internet, large amount of digital text is generated everyday in the form of
news articles, research publications, blogs, question answering forums and social media. It is
important to develop techniques for extracting information automatically from these documents,
as lot of important information is hidden within them. This extracted information can be used to
improve access and management of knowledge hidden in large text corpora. Several applications
such as Question Answering, Information Retrieval would benefit from this information. Entities
like persons and organizations, form the most basic unit of the information. Occurrences of entities
in a sentence are often linked through well-defined relations; e.g., occurrences of person and
organization in a sentence may be linked through relations such as employed at. The task of Relation
Extraction (RE) is to identify such relations automatically. In this paper, we survey several important
supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised RE techniques. We also cover the paradigms of Open
Information Extraction (OIE) and Distant Supervision. Finally, we describe some of the recent
trends in the RE techniques and possible future research directions. This survey would be useful
for three kinds of readers - i) Newcomers in the field who want to quickly learn about RE; ii) Researchers
who want to know how the various RE techniques evolved over time and what are possible future research
directions and iii) Practitioners who just need to know which RE technique works best in various
settings.
