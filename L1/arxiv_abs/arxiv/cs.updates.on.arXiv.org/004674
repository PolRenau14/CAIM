Stack Overflow (SO) is the most popular question-and-answer website for software developers,
providing a large amount of code snippets and free-form text on a wide variety of topics. Like other
software artifacts, questions and answers on SO evolve over time, for example when bugs in code snippets
are fixed, code is updated to work with a more recent library version, or text surrounding a code snippet
is edited for clarity. To be able to analyze how content on SO evolves, we built SOTorrent, an open
dataset based on the official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO
content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It connects SO posts to other
platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and by collecting references from GitHub files to
SO posts. In this paper, we describe how we built SOTorrent, and in particular how we evaluated 134
different string similarity metrics regarding their applicability for reconstructing the version
history of text and code blocks. Based on a first analysis using the dataset, we present insights
into the evolution of SO posts, e.g., that post edits are usually small, happen soon after the initial
creation of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the surrounding text.
Further, our analysis revealed a close relationship between post edits and comments. Our vision
is that researchers will use SOTorrent to investigate and understand the evolution of SO posts and
their relation to other platforms such as GitHub.
