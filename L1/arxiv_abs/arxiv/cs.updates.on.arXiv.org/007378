We introduce SCORES, a recursive neural network for shape composition. Our network takes as input
sets of parts from two or more source 3D shapes and a rough initial placement of the parts. It outputs
an optimized part structure for the composed shape, leading to high-quality geometry construction.
A unique feature of our composition network is that it is not merely learning how to connect parts.
Our goal is to produce a coherent and plausible 3D shape, despite large incompatibilities among
the input parts. The network may significantly alter the geometry and structure of the input parts
and synthesize a novel shape structure based on the inputs, while adding or removing parts to minimize
a structure plausibility loss. We design SCORES as a recursive autoencoder network. During encoding,
the input parts are recursively grouped to generate a root code. During synthesis, the root code
is decoded, recursively, to produce a new, coherent part assembly. Assembled shape structures
may be novel, with little global resemblance to training exemplars, yet have plausible substructures.
SCORES therefore learns a hierarchical substructure shape prior based on per-node losses. It is
trained on structured shapes from ShapeNet, and is applied iteratively to reduce the plausibility
loss.We showresults of shape composition from multiple sources over different categories of man-made
shapes and compare with state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrating that our network can significantly
expand the range of composable shapes for assembly-based modeling.
