We analyse how the standard reductions between constraint satisfaction problems affect their
proof complexity. We show that, for the most studied propositional, algebraic, and semi-algebraic
proof systems, the classical constructions of pp-interpretability, homomorphic equivalence
and addition of constants to a core preserve the proof complexity of the CSP. As a result, for those
proof systems, the classes of constraint languages for which small unsatisfiability certificates
exist can be characterised algebraically. We illustrate our results by a gap theorem saying that
a constraint language either has resolution refutations of constant width, or does not have bounded-depth
Frege refutations of subexponential size. The former holds exactly for the widely studied class
of constraint languages of bounded width. This class is also known to coincide with the class of languages
with refutations of sublinear degree in Sums-of-Squares and Polynomial Calculus over the real-field,
for which we provide alternative proofs. We then ask for the existence of a natural proof system with
good behaviour with respect to reductions and simultaneously small size refutations beyond bounded
width. We give an example of such a proof system by showing that bounded-degree Lov\'asz-Schrijver
satisfies both requirements. Finally, building on the known lower bounds, we demonstrate the applicability
of the method of reducibilities and construct new explicit hard instances of the graph 3-coloring
problem for all studied proof systems.
