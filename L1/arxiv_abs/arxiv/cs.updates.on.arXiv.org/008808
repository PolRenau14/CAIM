Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has the potential to improve the quality of life of people with a variety
of neurological diseases. A key challenge in DBS is in the placement of a stimulation electrode in
the anatomical location that maximizes efficacy and minimizes side effects. Pre-operative localization
of the optimal stimulation zone can reduce surgical times and morbidity. Current methods of producing
efficacy probability maps follow an anatomical guidance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
identify the areas with the highest efficacy in a population. In this work, we propose to revisit
this problem as a classification problem, where each voxel in the MRI is a sample informed by the surrounding
anatomy. We use a patch-based convolutional neural network to classify a stimulation coordinate
as having a positive reduction in symptoms during surgery. We use a cohort of 187 patients with a total
of 2,869 stimulation coordinates, upon which 3D patches were extracted and associated with an efficacy
score. We compare our results with a registration-based method of surgical planning. We show an
improvement in the classification of intraoperative stimulation coordinates as a positive response
in reduction of symptoms with AUC of 0.670 compared to a baseline registration-based approach,
which achieves an AUC of 0.627 (p < 0.01). Although additional validation is needed, the proposed
classification framework and deep learning method appear well-suited for improving pre-surgical
planning and personalize treatment strategies.
