With the transition of facial expression recognition (FER) from laboratory-controlled to challenging
in-the-wild conditions and the recent success of deep learning techniques in various fields, deep
neural networks have increasingly been leveraged to learn discriminative representations for
automatic FER. Recent deep FER systems generally focus on two important issues: overfitting caused
by a lack of sufficient training data and expression-unrelated variations, such as illumination,
head pose and identity bias. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on deep FER, including
datasets and algorithms that provide insights into these intrinsic problems. First, we describe
the standard pipeline of a deep FER system with the related background knowledge and suggestions
of applicable implementations for each stage. We then introduce the available datasets that are
widely used in the literature and provide accepted data selection and evaluation principles for
these datasets. For the state of the art in deep FER, we review existing novel deep neural networks
and related training strategies that are designed for FER based on both static images and dynamic
image sequences, and discuss their advantages and limitations. Competitive performances on widely
used benchmarks are also summarized in this section. We then extend our survey to additional related
issues and application scenarios. Finally, we review the remaining challenges and corresponding
opportunities in this field as well as future directions for the design of robust deep FER systems.
