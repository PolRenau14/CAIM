In industrial large-scale search systems, such as Taobao.com search for commodities, the quality
of the ranking result is getting continually improved by introducing more factors from complex
procedures, e.g., deep neural networks for extracting image factors. Meanwhile, the increasing
of the factors demands more computation resource and raises the system response latency. It has
been observed that a search instance usually requires only a small set of effective factors, instead
of all factors. Therefore, removing ineffective factors significantly improves the system efficiency.
This paper studies the \emph{Contextual Factor Selection} (CFS), which selects only a subset of
effective factors for every search instance, for a well balance between the search quality and the
response latency. We inject CFS into the search engine ranking score to accelerate the engine, considering
both ranking effectiveness and efficiency. The learning of the CFS model involves a combinatorial
optimization, which is transformed as a sequential decision-making problem. Solving the problem
by reinforcement learning, we propose the RankCFS, which has been assessed in an off-line environment
as well as a real-world on-line environment (Taobao.com). The empirical results show that, the
proposed CFS approach outperforms several existing supervised/unsupervised methods for feature
selection in the off-line environment, and also achieves significant real-world performance
improvement, in term of service latency, in daily test as well as Singles' Day Shopping Festival
