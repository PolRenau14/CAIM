We consider the problem of recovering the superposition of $R$ distinct complex exponential functions
from compressed non-uniform time-domain samples. Total Variation (TV) minimization or atomic
norm minimization was proposed in the literature to recover the $R$ frequencies or the missing data.
However, it is known that in order for TV minimization and atomic norm minimization to recover the
missing data or the frequencies, the underlying $R$ frequencies are required to be well-separated,
even when the measurements are noiseless. This paper shows that the Hankel matrix recovery approach
can super-resolve the $R$ complex exponentials and their frequencies from compressed non-uniform
measurements, regardless of how close their frequencies are to each other. We propose a new concept
of orthonormal atomic norm minimization (OANM), and demonstrate that the success of Hankel matrix
recovery in separation-free super-resolution comes from the fact that the nuclear norm of a Hankel
matrix is an orthonormal atomic norm. More specifically, we show that, in traditional atomic norm
minimization, the underlying parameter values $\textbf{must}$ be well separated to achieve successful
signal recovery, if the atoms are changing continuously with respect to the continuously-valued
parameter. In contrast, for the OANM, it is possible the OANM is successful even though the original
atoms can be arbitrarily close. As a byproduct of this research, we provide one matrix-theoretic
inequality of nuclear norm, and give its proof from the theory of compressed sensing.
