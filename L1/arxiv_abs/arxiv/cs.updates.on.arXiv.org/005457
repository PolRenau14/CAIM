Identifying potential abuses of human rights through imagery is a novel and challenging task in
the field of computer vision, that will enable to expose human rights violations over large-scale
data that may otherwise be impossible. While standard databases for object and scene categorisation
contain hundreds of different classes, the largest available dataset of human rights violations
contains only 4 classes. Here, we introduce the `Human Rights Archive Database' (HRA), a verified-by-experts
repository of 3050 human rights violations photographs, labelled with human rights semantic categories,
comprising a list of the types of human rights abuses encountered at present. With the HRA dataset
and a two-phase transfer learning scheme, we fine-tuned the state-of-the-art deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to provide human rights violations classification CNNs (HRA-CNNs). We
also present extensive experiments refined to evaluate how well object-centric and scene-centric
CNN features can be combined for the task of recognising human rights abuses. With this, we show that
HRA database poses a challenge at a higher level for the well studied representation learning methods,
and provide a benchmark in the task of human rights violations recognition in visual context. We
expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognising rich
information about human rights violations. Our dataset, codes and trained models are available
