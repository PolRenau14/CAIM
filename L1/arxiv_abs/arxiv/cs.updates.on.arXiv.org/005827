Voice disguise, purposeful modification of one's speaker identity with the aim of avoiding being
identified as oneself, is a low-effort way to fool speaker recognition, whether performed by a human
or an automatic speaker verification (ASV) system. We present an evaluation of the effectiveness
of age stereotypes as a voice disguise strategy, as a follow up to our recent work where 60 native Finnish
speakers attempted to sound like an elderly and like a child. In that study, we presented evidence
that both ASV and human observers could easily miss the target speaker but we did not address how believable
the presented vocal age stereotypes were; this study serves to fill that gap. The interesting cases
would be speakers who succeed in being missed by the ASV system, and which a typical listener cannot
detect as being a disguise. We carry out a perceptual test to study the quality of the disguised speech
samples. The listening test was carried out both locally and with the help of Amazon's Mechanical
Turk (MT) crowd-workers. A total of 91 listeners participated in the test and were instructed to
estimate both the speaker's chronological and intended age. The results indicate that age estimations
for the intended old and child voices for female speakers were towards the target age groups, while
for male speakers, the age estimations corresponded to the direction of the target voice only for
elderly voices. In the case of intended child's voice, listeners estimated the age of male speakers
to be older than their chronological age for most of the speakers and not the intended target age.
