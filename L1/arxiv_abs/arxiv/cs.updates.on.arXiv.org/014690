An online evolving framework is proposed to support modeling the safe Automated Vehicle (AV) control
system by making the controller able to recognize unexpected situations and react appropriately
by choosing a better action. Within the framework, the evolving Finite State Machine (e-FSM), which
is an online model able to (1) determine states uniquely as needed, (2) recognize states, and (3)
identify state-transitions, is introduced. In this study, the e-FSM's capabilities are explained
and illustrated by simulating a simple car-following scenario. As a vehicle controller, the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM) is implemented, and different sets of IDM parameters are assigned to the following
vehicle for simulating various situations (including the collision). While simulating the car-following
scenario, e-FSM recognizes and determines the states and identifies the transition matrices by
suggested methods. To verify if e-FSM can recognize and determine states uniquely, we analyze whether
the same state is recognized under the identical situation. The difference between probability
distributions of predicted and recognized states is measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence
(JSD) method to validate the accuracy of identified transition-matrices. As shown in the results,
the Dead-End state which has latent-risk of the collision is uniquely determined and consistently
recognized. Also, the probability distributions of the predicted state are significantly similar
to the recognized state, declaring that the state-transitions are precisely identified.
