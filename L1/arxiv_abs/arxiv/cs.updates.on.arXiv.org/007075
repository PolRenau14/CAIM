The advanced development of the Internet facilitates efficient information exchange while also
been exploited by adversaries. Intrusion detection system (IDS) as an important defense component
of network security has always been widely studied in security research. However, research on intrusion
prediction, which is more critical for network security, is received less attention. We argue that
the advanced anticipation and timely impede of invasion is more vital than simple alarms in security
defenses. General research methods regarding prediction are analyzing short term of system-calls
to predict forthcoming abnormal behaviors. In this paper we take advantages of the remarkable performance
of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with long sequential problem, introducing the sequence-to-sequence
model into our intrusion prediction work. By semantic modeling system-calls we build a robust system-call
sequence-to-sequence prediction model. With taking the system-call traces invoked during the
program running as known prerequisite, our model predicts sequence of system-calls that is most
likely to be executed in a near future period of time that enabled the ability of monitoring system
status and prophesying the intrusion behaviors. Our experiments show that the predict method proposed
in this paper achieved well prediction performance on ADFALD intrusion detection test data set.
Moreover, the predicted sequence, combined with the known invoked traces of system, significantly
improves the performance of intrusion detection verified on various classifiers.
