Ultrasound (US) can be used to assess brain development in newborns, as MRI is challenging due to
immobilization issues, and may require sedation. Dilatation of the lateral ventricles in the brain
is a risk factor for poorer neurodevelopment outcomes in infants. Hence, 3D US has the ability to
assess the volume of the lateral ventricles similar to clinically standard MRI, but manual segmentation
is time consuming. The objective of this study is to develop an approach quantifying the ratio of
lateral ventricular dilatation with respect to total brain volume using 3D US, which can assess
the severity of macrocephaly. Automatic segmentation of the lateral ventricles is achieved with
a multi-atlas deformable registration approach using locally linear correlation metrics for
US-MRI fusion, followed by a refinement step using deformable mesh models. Total brain volume is
estimated using a 3D ellipsoid modeling approach. Validation was performed on a cohort of 12 infants,
ranging from 2 to 8.5 months old, where 3D US and MRI were used to compare brain volumes and segmented
lateral ventricles. Automatically extracted volumes from 3D US show a high correlation and no statistically
significant difference when compared to ground truth measurements. Differences in volume ratios
was 6.0 +/- 4.8% compared to MRI, while lateral ventricular segmentation yielded a mean Dice coefficient
of 70.8 +/- 3.6% and a mean absolute distance (MAD) of 0.88 +/- 0.2mm, demonstrating the clinical
benefit of this tool in paediatric ultrasound.
