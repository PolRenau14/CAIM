Clustering is a fundamental tool in data mining. It partitions points into groups (clusters) and
may be used to make decisions for each point based on its group. However, this process may harm protected
(minority) classes if the clustering algorithm does not adequately represent them in desirable
clusters -- especially if the data is already biased. At NIPS 2017, Chierichetti et al. proposed
a model for fair clustering requiring the representation in each cluster to (approximately) preserve
the global fraction of each protected class. Restricting to two protected classes, they developed
both a 4-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem and a $O(t)$-approximation for the fair
$k$-median problem, where $t$ is a parameter for the fairness model. For multiple protected classes,
the best known result is a 14-approximation for fair $k$-center. We extend and improve the known
results. Firstly, we give a 5-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem with multiple protected
classes. Secondly, we propose a relaxed fairness notion under which we can give bicriteria constant-factor
approximations for all of the classical clustering objectives $k$-center, $k$-supplier, $k$-median,
$k$-means and facility location. The latter approximations are achieved by a framework that takes
an arbitrary existing unfair (integral) solution and a fair (fractional) LP solution and combines
them into an essentially fair clustering with a weakly supervised rounding scheme. In this way,
a fair clustering can be established belatedly, in a situation where the centers are already fixed.
