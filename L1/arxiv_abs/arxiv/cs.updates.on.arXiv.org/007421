We study a cooperative network with a buffer-aided multi-antenna source, multiple half-duplex
(HD) buffer-aided relays and a single destination. Such a setup could represent a cellular downlink
scenario, in which the source can be a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas,
while a set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the destination. The
main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network by having the source and a relay to simultaneously
transmit their information to another relay and the destination, respectively. Successive transmissions
in such a cooperative network, however, cause inter-relay interference (IRI). First, by assuming
global channel state information (CSI), we show that the detrimental effect of IRI can be alleviated
by precoding at the source, mitigating or even fully cancelling the interference. A cooperative
relaying policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay-pair selection. Note
that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be considered. For the case when channel
state information is only available at the receiver side (CSIR), we propose a relay selection policy
that employs a phase alignment technique to reduce the IRI. The performance of the two proposed relay
pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art relaying schemes
in terms of outage and throughput. The results show that the use of a powerful source can provide considerable
performance improvements.
