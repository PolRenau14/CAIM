Lesion segmentation is the first step in most automatic melanoma recognition systems. Deficiencies
and difficulties in dermoscopic images such as color inconstancy, hair occlusion, dark corners
and color charts make lesion segmentation an intricate task. In order to detect the lesion in the
presence of these problems, we propose a supervised saliency detection method tailored for dermoscopic
images based on the discriminative regional feature integration (DRFI). DRFI method incorporates
multi-level segmentation, regional contrast, property, background descriptors, and a random
forest regressor to create saliency scores for each region in the image. In our improved saliency
detection method, mDRFI, we have added some new features to regional property descriptors. Also,
in order to achieve more robust regional background descriptors, a thresholding algorithm is proposed
to obtain a new pseudo-background region. Findings reveal that mDRFI is superior to DRFI in detecting
the lesion as the salient object in dermoscopic images. The proposed overall lesion segmentation
framework uses detected saliency map to construct an initial mask of the lesion through thresholding
and post-processing operations. The initial mask is then evolving in a level set framework to fit
better on the lesion's boundaries. The results of evaluation tests on three public datasets show
that our proposed segmentation method outperforms the other conventional state-of-the-art segmentation
algorithms and its performance is comparable with most recent approaches that are based on deep
convolutional neural networks.
