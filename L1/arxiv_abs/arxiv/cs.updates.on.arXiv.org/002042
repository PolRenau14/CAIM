Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in natural language processing and computer
vision. Among them, the Hierarchical Multi-scale RNN (HM-RNN), a kind of multi-scale hierarchical
RNN proposed recently, can learn the hierarchical temporal structure from data automatically.
In this paper, we extend the work to solve the computer vision task of action recognition. However,
in sequence-to-sequence models like RNN, it is normally very hard to discover the relationships
between inputs and outputs given static inputs. As a solution, attention mechanism could be applied
to extract the relevant information from input thus facilitating the modeling of input-output
relationships. Based on these considerations, we propose a novel attention network, namely Hierarchical
Multi-scale Attention Network (HM-AN), by combining the HM-RNN and the attention mechanism and
apply it to action recognition. A newly proposed gradient estimation method for stochastic neurons,
namely Gumbel-softmax, is exploited to implement the temporal boundary detectors and the stochastic
hard attention mechanism. To amealiate the negative effect of sensitive temperature of the Gumbel-softmax,
an adaptive temperature training method is applied to better the system performance. The experimental
results demonstrate the improved effect of HM-AN over LSTM with attention on the vision task. Through
visualization of what have been learnt by the networks, it can be observed that both the attention
regions of images and the hierarchical temporal structure can be captured by HM-AN.
