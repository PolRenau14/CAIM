Protecting data in the cloud continues to gain in importance, with encryption being used to achieve
the desired data protection. While there is desire to use encryption, various cloud components
do not want to deal with key management, which points to a strong need for a separate key management
system. OpenStack Barbican is a platform developed by the OpenStack community aimed at providing
cryptographic functions useful for all environments, including large ephemeral clouds. Barbican
exposes REST APIs designed for the secure storage, provisioning and management of secrets such
as passwords, encryption keys, and X.509 certificates, and supports plugins for a variety of crypto
solutions in the backend. Crypto plugins store secrets as encrypted blobs within the Barbican database.
Software based crypto plugins offer a scalable solution, but are vulnerable to system software
attacks. Hardware Security Module or HSM plugins offer strong security guarantees, but they are
expensive and don't scale well. We propose to build an Intel Software Guard Extension or SGX based
software crypto plugin that offers security similar to an HSM with the low cost and scalability of
a software based solution. We extend OpenStack Barbican API to support attestation of an Intel SGX
crypto plugin, to allow clients higher confidence in the software they are using for storing keys.
In addition, the API provides support for mutual attestation for Intel SGX enabled clients, multi-user
key distribution, and extensions for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the backend
database.
