Background: The biological world is replete with phenomena that appear to be ideally modeled and
analyzed by one archetypal statistical framework - the Graphical Probabilistic Model (GPM). The
structure of GPMs is a uniquely good match for biological problems that range from aligning sequences
to modeling the genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address
involve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors. Unfortunately, while GPMs
ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not an easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not
a simple task for an end user. Moreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the
complex web of interacting factors inherent to a problem might be easy to define and also intractable
to compute upon. Discussion: We propose that the visualization sciences can contribute to many
domains of the bio-sciences, by developing tools to address archetypal representation and user
interaction issues in GPMs, and in particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF).
CRFs bring additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency network can
be conditioned on the query data. Conclusions: In this manuscript we examine the shared features
of several biological problems that are amenable to modeling with CRFs, highlight the challenges
that existing visualization and visual analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document
an experimental solution called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been
successfully applied in several biological research projects.
