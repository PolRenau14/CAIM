Inverse imaging problems are inherently under-determined, and hence it is important to employ
appropriate image priors for regularization. One recent popular prior---the graph Laplacian
regularizer---assumes that the target pixel patch is smooth with respect to an appropriately chosen
graph. However, the mechanisms and implications of imposing the graph Laplacian regularizer on
the original inverse problem are not well understood. To address this problem, in this paper we interpret
neighborhood graphs of pixel patches as discrete counterparts of Riemannian manifolds and perform
analysis in the continuous domain, providing insights into several fundamental aspects of graph
Laplacian regularization for image denoising. Specifically, we first show the convergence of
the graph Laplacian regularizer to a continuous-domain functional, integrating a norm measured
in a locally adaptive metric space. Focusing on image denoising, we derive an optimal metric space
assuming non-local self-similarity of pixel patches, leading to an optimal graph Laplacian regularizer
for denoising in the discrete domain. We then interpret graph Laplacian regularization as an anisotropic
diffusion scheme to explain its behavior during iterations, e.g., its tendency to promote piecewise
smooth signals under certain settings. To verify our analysis, an iterative image denoising algorithm
is developed. Experimental results show that our algorithm performs competitively with state-of-the-art
denoising methods such as BM3D for natural images, and outperforms them significantly for piecewise
smooth images.
