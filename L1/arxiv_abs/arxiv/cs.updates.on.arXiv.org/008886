Concepts from mathematical crystallography and group theory are used here to quantize the group
of rigid-body motions, resulting in a "motion alphabet" with which to express robot motion primitives.
From these primitives it is possible to develop a dictionary of physical actions. Equipped with
an alphabet of the sort developed here, intelligent actions of robots in the world can be approximated
with finite sequences of characters, thereby forming the foundation of a language in which to articulate
robot motion. In particular, we use the discrete handedness-preserving symmetries of macromolecular
crystals (known in mathematical crystallography as Sohncke space groups) to form a coarse discretization
of the space $\rm{SE}(3)$ of rigid-body motions. This discretization is made finer by subdividing
using the concept of double-coset decomposition. More specifically, a very efficient, equivolumetric
quantization of spatial motion can be defined using the group-theoretic concept of a double-coset
decomposition of the form $\Gamma \backslash \rm{SE}(3) / \Delta$, where $\Gamma$ is a Sohncke
space group and $\Delta$ is a finite group of rotational symmetries such as those of the icosahedron.
The resulting discrete alphabet is based on a very uniform sampling of $\rm{SE}(3)$ and is a tool
for describing the continuous trajectories of robots and humans. The general "signals to symbols"
problem in artificial intelligence is cast in this framework for robots moving continuously in
the world, and we present a coarse-to-fine search scheme here to efficiently solve this decoding
problem in practice.
