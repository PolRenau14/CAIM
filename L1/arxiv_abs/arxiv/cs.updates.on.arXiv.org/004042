Randomized algorithms for low-rank matrix approximation are investigated, with the emphasis
on the fixed-precision problem and computational efficiency for handling large matrices. The
algorithms are based on the so-called QB factorization, where Q is an orthonormal matrix. Firstly,
a mechanism for calculating the approximation error in Frobenius norm is proposed, which enables
efficient adaptive rank determination for large and/or sparse matrix. It can be combined with any
QB-form factorization algorithm in which B's rows are incrementally generated. Based on the blocked
randQB algorithm by P.-G. Martinsson and S. Voronin, this results in an algorithm called randQB
EI. Then, we further revise the algorithm to obtain a pass-efficient algorithm, randQB FP, which
is mathematically equivalent to the existing randQB algorithms and also suitable for the fixed-precision
problem. Especially, randQB FP can serve as a single-pass algorithm for calculating leading singular
values, under certain condition. With large and/or sparse test matrices, we have empirically validated
the merits of the proposed techniques, which exhibit remarkable speedup and memory saving over
the blocked randQB algorithm. We have also demonstrated that the single-pass algorithm derived
by randQB FP is much more accurate than an existing single-pass algorithm. And with data from a scenic
image and an information retrieval application, we have shown the advantages of the proposed algorithms
over the adaptive range finder algorithm for solving the fixed-precision problem.
