In this paper we describe a framework towards computing well-localized, robust motion plans through
the perception-aware motion planning problem, whereby we seek a low-cost motion plan subject to
a separate constraint on perception localization quality. To solve this problem we introduce the
Multiobjective Perception-Aware Planning (MPAP) algorithm which explores the state space via
a multiobjective search, considering both cost and a perception heuristic. This framework can
accommodate a large range of heuristics, allowing those that capture the history dependence of
localization drift and represent complex modern perception methods. We present two such heuristics,
one derived from a simplified model of robot perception and a second learned from ground-truth sensor
error, which we show to be capable of predicting the performance of a state-of-the-art perception
system. The solution trajectory from this heuristic-based search is then certified via Monte Carlo
methods to be well-localized and robust. The additional computational burden of perception-aware
planning is offset by GPU massive parallelization. Through numerical experiments the algorithm
is shown to find well-localized, robust solutions in about a second. Finally, we demonstrate MPAP
on a quadrotor flying perception-aware and perception-agnostic plans using Google Tango for localization,
finding the quadrotor safely executes the perception-aware plan every time, while crashing in
over 20% of the perception-agnostic runs due to loss of localization.
