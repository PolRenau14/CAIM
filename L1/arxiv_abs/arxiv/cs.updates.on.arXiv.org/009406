It is known that the bit errors of polar codes with successive cancellation (SC) decoding are coupled.
However, existing concatenation schemes of polar codes with other error correction codes rarely
take this coupling effect into consideration. To achieve a better error performance of concatenated
systems with polar codes as inner codes, one can divide all bits in an outer block into different polar
blocks to completely de-correlate the possible coupled errors in the transmitter side. We call
this interleaving a blind interleaving (BI) which serves as a benchmark. Two BI schemes, termed
BI-DP and BI-CDP, are proposed in the paper. To better balance performance, memory size, and the
decoding delay from the de-interleaving, a novel interleaving scheme, named the correlation-breaking
interleaving (CBI), is proposed. The CBI breaks the correlated information bits based on the error
correlation pattern proposed and proven in this paper. The proposed CBI scheme is general in the
sense that any error correction code can serve as the outer code. In this paper, Low-Density Parity-Check
(LDPC) codes and BCH codes are used as two examples of the outer codes of the interleaving scheme.
The CBI scheme 1) can keep the simple SC polar decoding while achieving a better error performance
than the state-of-the-art (SOA) direct concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes and BCH codes;
2) achieves a comparable error performance as the BI-DP scheme with a smaller memory size and a shorter
decoding delay. Numerical results are provided to verify the performance of the BI schemes and the
CBI scheme.
