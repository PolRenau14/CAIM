Pathological Hand Tremor (PHT) is among common symptoms of several neurological movement disorders,
which can significantly degrade quality of life of affected individuals. Beside pharmaceutical
and surgical therapies, mechatronic technologies have been utilized to control PHTs. Most of these
technologies function based on estimation, extraction, and characterization of tremor movement
signals. Real-time extraction of tremor signal is of paramount importance because of its application
in assistive and rehabilitative devices. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line adaptive method
which can adjust the hyper-parameters of the filter to the variable characteristics of the tremor.
The proposed "WAKE: Wavelet decomposition coupled with Adaptive Kalman filtering technique for
pathological tremor Extraction, referred to as the WAKE framework" is composed of a new adaptive
Kalman filter and a wavelet transform core to provide indirect prediction of the tremor, one sample
ahead of time, to be used for its suppression. In this paper, the design, implementation and evaluation
of WAKE are given. The performance is evaluated based on three different datasets, the first one
is a synthetic dataset, developed in this work, that simulates hand tremor under ten different conditions.
The second and third ones are real datasets recorded from patients with PHTs. The results obtained
from the proposed WAKE framework demonstrate significant improvements in the estimation accuracy
in comparison with two well regarded techniques in the literature.
