The row (resp. column) rank profile of a matrix describes the stair-case shape of its row (resp. column)
echelon form. We here propose a new matrix invariant, the rank profile matrix, summarizing all information
on the row and column rank profiles of all the leading sub-matrices. We show that this normal form
exists and is unique over any ring, provided that the notion of McCoy's rank is used, in the presence
of zero divisors. We then explore the conditions for a Gaussian elimination algorithm to compute
all or part of this invariant, through the corresponding PLUQ decomposition. This enlarges the
set of known Elimination variants that compute row or column rank profiles. As a consequence a new
Crout base case variant significantly improves the practical efficiency of previously known implementations
over a finite field. With matrices of very small rank, we also generalize the techniques of Storjohann
and Yang to the computation of the rank profile matrix, achieving an $(r^\omega+mn)^{1+o(1)}$
time complexity for an $m \times n$ matrix of rank $r$, where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication.
Finally, by give connections to the Bruhat decomposition, and several of its variants and generalizations.
Thus, our algorithmic improvements for the PLUQ factorization, and their implementations, directly
apply to these decompositions. In particular, we show how a PLUQ decomposition revealing the rank
profile matrix also reveals both a row and a column echelon form of the input matrix or of any of its
leading sub-matrices, by a simple post-processing made of row and column permutations.
