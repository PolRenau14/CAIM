Nowadays, mobile banking becomes a popular tool which consumers can conduct financial transactions
such as shopping, monitoring accounts balance, transferring funds and other payments. Consumers
dependency on mobile needs, make people take a little bit more interest in mobile banking. The use
of the one-time password which is sent to the user mobile phone by short message service (SMS) is a
vulnerability which we want to solve with proposing a new scheme called S-Mbank. We replace the authentication
using the one-time password with the contactless smart card to prevent attackers to use the unencrypted
message which is sent to the user's mobile phone. Moreover, it deals vulnerability of spoofer to
send an SMS pretending as a bank's server. The contactless smart card is proposed because of its flexibility
and security which easier to bring in our wallet than the common passcode generators. The replacement
of SMS-based authentication with contactless smart card removes the vulnerability of unauthorized
users to act as a legitimate user to exploit the mobile banking user's account. Besides that, we use
public-private key pair and PIN to provide two factors authentication and mutual authentication.
We use signcryption scheme to provide the efficiency of the computation. Pair based text authentication
is also proposed for the login process as a solution to shoulder-surfing attack. We use Scyther tool
to analyze the security of authentication protocol in S-Mbank scheme. From the proposed scheme,
we are able to provide more security protection for mobile banking service.
