Despite years of intensive research in the field of software vulnerabilities discovery, exploits
are becoming ever more common. Consequently, it is more necessary than ever to choose software configurations
that minimize systems' exposure surface to these threats. In order to support users in assessing
the security risks induced by their software configurations and in making informed decisions,
we introduce M-STAR, a Modular Software Trustworthiness ARchitecture and framework for probabilistically
assessing the trustworthiness of software systems, based on evidence, such as their vulnerability
history and source code properties. Integral to M-STAR is a software trustworthiness model, consistent
with the concept of computational trust. Computational trust models are rooted in Bayesian probability
and Dempster-Shafer Belief theory, offering mathematical soundness and expressiveness to our
framework. To evaluate our framework, we instantiate M-STAR for Debian Linux packages, and investigate
real-world deployment scenarios. In our experiments with real-world data, M-STAR could assess
the relative trustworthiness of complete software configurations with an error of less than 10%.
Due to its modular design, our proposed framework is agile, as it can incorporate future advances
in the field of code analysis and vulnerability prediction. Our results point out that M-STAR can
be a valuable tool for system administrators, regular users and developers, helping them assess
and manage risks associated with their software configurations.
