While the smart surveillance system enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology becomes
an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new concerns in security of the data. Compared to
the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry
out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems
are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis
at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of
the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach
owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel
secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology.
Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates
the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness
by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video
analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof
of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy
prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized
and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.
