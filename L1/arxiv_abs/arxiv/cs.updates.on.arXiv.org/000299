P2P architecture is a viable option for enterprise backup. In contrast to dedicated backup servers,
nowadays a standard solution, making backups directly on organization's workstations should
be cheaper (as existing hardware is used), more efficient (as there is no single bottleneck server)
and more reliable (as the machines are geographically dispersed). We present the architecture
of a p2p backup system that uses pairwise replication contracts between a data owner and a replicator.
In contrast to standard p2p storage systems using directly a DHT, the contracts allow our system
to optimize replicas' placement depending on a specific optimization strategy, and so to take advantage
of the heterogeneity of the machines and the network. Such optimization is particularly appealing
in the context of backup: replicas can be geographically dispersed, the load sent over the network
can be minimized, or the optimization goal can be to minimize the backup/restore time. However,
managing the contracts, keeping them consistent and adjusting them in response to dynamically
changing environment is challenging. We built a scientific prototype and ran the experiments on
150 workstations in the university's computer laboratories and, separately, on 50 PlanetLab nodes.
We found out that the main factor affecting the quality of the system is the availability of the machines.
Yet, our main conclusion is that it is possible to build an efficient and reliable backup system on
highly unreliable machines (our computers had just 13% average availability).
