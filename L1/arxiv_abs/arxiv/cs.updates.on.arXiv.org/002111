There have been many proposals for sorting integers on multicores/GPUs that include radix-sort
and its variants or other approaches that exploit specialized hardware features of a particular
multicore architecture. Comparison-based algorithms have also been used. Network-based algorithms
have also been used with primary example Batcher's bitonic sorting algorithm. Although such a latter
approach is theoretically "inefficient", if there are few keys to sort, it can lead to better running
times as it has low overhead and is simple to implement. In this work we perform an experimental study
of integer sorting on multicore processors using not only multithreading but also multiprocessing
parallel programming approaches. Our implementations work under Open MPI, MulticoreBSP, and
BSPlib. We have implemented serial and parallel radix-sort for various radixes and also some previously
little explored or unexplored variants of bitonic-sort and odd-even transposition sort. We offer
our observations on a performance evaluation using the MBSP model of such algorithm implementations
on multiple platforms and architectures and multiple programming libraries. If we can conclude
anything is that modeling their performance by taking into consideration architecture dependent
features such as the structure and characteristics of multiple memory hierarchies is difficult
and more often than not unsuccessful or unreliable. However we can still draw some very simple conclusions
using traditional architecture independent parallel modeling.
