Until recently, transcriptomics was limited to bulk RNA sequencing, obscuring the underlying
expression patterns of individual cells in favor of a global average. Thanks to technological advances,
we can now profile gene expression across thousands or millions of individual cells in parallel.
This new type of data has led to the intriguing discovery that individual cell profiles can reflect
the imprint of time or dynamic processes. However, synthesizing this information to reconstruct
dynamic biological phenomena from data that are noisy, heterogenous, and sparse---and from processes
that may unfold asynchronously---poses a complex computational and statistical challenge. Here,
we develop a full generative model for probabilistically reconstructing trees of cellular differentiation
from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, we extend the framework of the classical Dirichlet
diffusion tree to simultaneously infer branch topology and latent cell states along continuous
trajectories over the full tree. In tandem, we construct a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler
that interleaves Metropolis-Hastings and message passing to leverage model structure for efficient
inference. Finally, we demonstrate that these techniques can recover latent trajectories from
simulated single-cell transcriptomes. While this work is motivated by cellular differentiation,
we derive a tractable model that provides flexible densities for any data (coupled with an appropriate
noise model) that arise from continuous evolution along a latent nonparametric tree.
