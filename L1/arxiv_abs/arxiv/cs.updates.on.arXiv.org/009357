Machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and other modern statistical methods are
providing new opportunities to operationalize previously untapped and rapidly growing sources
of data for patient benefit. Whilst there is a lot of promising research currently being undertaken,
the literature as a whole lacks: transparency; clear reporting to facilitate replicability; exploration
for potential ethical concerns; and, clear demonstrations of effectiveness. There are many reasons
for why these issues exist, but one of the most important that we provide a preliminary solution for
here is the current lack of ML/AI- specific best practice guidance. Although there is no consensus
on what best practice looks in this field, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research
and impact projects in the ML/AI for health domain would benefit from answering a series of questions
based on the important issues that exist when undertaking work of this nature. Here we present 20
questions that span the entire project life cycle, from inception, data analysis, and model evaluation,
to implementation, as a means to facilitate project planning and post-hoc (structured) independent
evaluation. By beginning to answer these questions in different settings, we can start to understand
what constitutes a good answer, and we expect that the resulting discussion will be central to developing
an international consensus framework for transparent, replicable, ethical and effective research
in artificial intelligence (AI-TREE) for health.
