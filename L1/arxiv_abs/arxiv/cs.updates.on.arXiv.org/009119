Privacy problems are lethal and getting more attention than any other issue with the notion of the
Internet of Things (IoT). Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids,
smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications
are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered
by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important
aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation
techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However,
when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy
problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques
have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor
nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this
paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy
Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the
sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute
steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and
comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.
