Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enables placing video content at the edge of the network aiming
to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of the mobile clients. Video content caching at edge servers
also reduces traffic in the backhaul of the mobile network, hence reducing operational costs for
mobile network operators (MNOs). However, minimizing the rate of cache misses and maximizing the
average video quality may sometimes be at odds with each other, particularly when the cache size
is constrained. Our objective in this article is two fold: First, we explore the impact of fixed video
content caching on the optimal QoE of mobile clients in a setup where servers at mobile network edge
handle bitrate selection. Second, we want to investigate the effect of cache replacement on QoE-traffic
trade-off. An integer nonlinear programming (INLP) optimization model is formulated for the problem
of jointly maximizing the QoE, the fairness as well as minimizing overall data traffic on the origin
video server. Due to its NP-Hardness, we then present a low complexity greedy-based algorithm with
minimum need for parameter tuning which can be easily deployed. We show through simulations that
the joint optimization indeed enables striking a desired trade-off between traffic reduction
and QoE. The results also reveal that with fixed cached contents, the impact of caching on the QoE
is proportional to the desired operational point of MNO. Furthermore, the effect of cache replacement
on QoE is less noticeable compared to its effect on backhaul traffic when cache size is constrained.
