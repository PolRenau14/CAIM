Fashion, and especially apparel, is the fastest-growing category in online shopping. As consumers
requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods for which their appearance matters most,
images play a key role not only in conveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but
also in affecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However, research related
to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at perceptual level, but not the quality
of content, and the way of presenting. This study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image
in showcasing fashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw consumer's
attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply advanced vision technique to quantize
attractiveness using three common display types in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin,
and flat. We perform two-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online
market, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our understandings on consumer's
reasoning logic behind the action. We propose a Fisher noncentral hypergeometric distribution
based user choice model to quantitatively evaluate user's preference. Further, we investigate
the potentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's preference. A
visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates both presentation efficacy and
user preference is proposed. We show quantitative improvement by promoting visual attractiveness
into search on top of relevance.
