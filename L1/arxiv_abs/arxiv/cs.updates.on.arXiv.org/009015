Tensor network decomposition, originated from quantum physics to model entangled many-particle
quantum systems, turns out to be a promising mathematical technique to efficiently represent and
process big data in parsimonious manner. In this study, we show that tensor networks can systematically
partition structured data, e.g. color images, for distributed storage and communication in privacy-preserving
manner. Leveraging the sea of big data and metadata privacy, empirical results show that neighbouring
subtensors with implicit information stored in tensor network formats cannot be identified for
data reconstruction. This technique complements the existing encryption and randomization techniques
which store explicit data representation at one place and highly susceptible to adversarial attacks
such as side-channel attacks and de-anonymization. Furthermore, we propose a theory for adversarial
examples that mislead convolutional neural networks to misclassification using subspace analysis
based on singular value decomposition (SVD). The theory is extended to analyze higher-order tensors
using tensor-train SVD (TT-SVD); it helps to explain the level of susceptibility of different datasets
to adversarial attacks, the structural similarity of different adversarial attacks including
global and localized attacks, and the efficacy of different adversarial defenses based on input
transformation. An efficient and adaptive algorithm based on robust TT-SVD is then developed to
detect strong and static adversarial attacks.
