Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is a new technological shift which exploits the computation and
storage resources on vehicles for computational service provisioning. Spare on-board resources
are pooled by a VCC operator, e.g. a roadside unit, to complete task requests using the vehicle-as-a-resource
framework. In this paper, we investigate timely service provisioning for deadline-constrained
tasks in VCC systems by leveraging the task replication technique (i.e., allowing one task to be
executed by several server vehicles). A learning-based algorithm, called DATE-V (Deadline-Aware
Task rEplication for Vehicular Cloud), is proposed to address the special issues in VCC systems
including uncertainty of vehicle movements, volatile vehicle members, and large vehicle population.
The proposed algorithm is developed based on a novel Contextual-Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit
(CC-MAB) learning framework. DATE-V is `contextual' because it utilizes side information (context)
of vehicles and tasks to infer the completion probability of a task replication under random vehicle
movements. DATE-V is `combinatorial' because it aims to replicate the received task and send the
task replications to multiple server vehicles to guarantee the service timeliness. We rigorously
prove that our learning algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound compared to an oracle algorithm
that knows the exact completion probability of any task replications. Simulations are carried
out based on real-world vehicle movement traces and the results show that DATE-V significantly
outperforms benchmark solutions.
