Line of Sight (LoS) networks were designed to model wireless communication in settings which may
contain obstacles restricting node visibility. For fixed positive integer $d$, and positive integer
$\omega$, a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a ($d$-dimensional) LoS network with range parameter $\omega$ if
it can be embedded in a cube of side size $n$ of the $d$-dimensional integer grid so that each pair of
vertices in $V$ are adjacent if and only if their embedding coordinates differ only in one position
and such difference is less than $\omega$. In this paper we investigate a dynamic programming (DP)
approach which can be used to obtain efficient algorithmic solutions for various combinatorial
problems in LoS networks. In particular DP solves the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem in LoS
networks optimally for any $\omega$ on {\em narrow} LoS networks (i.e. networks which can be embedded
in a $n \times k \times k \ldots \times k$ region, for some fixed $k$ independent of $n$). In the unrestricted
case it has been shown that the MIS problem is NP-hard when $ \omega > 2$ (the hardness proof goes through
for any $\omega=O(n^{1-\delta})$, for fixed $0<\delta<1$). We describe how DP can be used as a building
block in the design of good approximation algorithms. In particular we present a 2-approximation
algorithm and a fast polynomial time approximation scheme for the MIS problem in arbitrary $d$-dimensional
LoS networks. Finally we comment on how the approach can be adapted to solve a number of important
optimization problems in LoS networks.
