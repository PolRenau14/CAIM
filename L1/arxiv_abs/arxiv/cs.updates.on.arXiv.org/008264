We show that data collected from corpuses of documents violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
version of Bell's inequality (CHSH inequality) and therefore indicate the presence of quantum
entanglement in their structure. We obtain this result by considering two concepts and their combination
and coincidence operations consisting of searches of co-occurrences of exemplars of these concepts
in specific corpuses of documents. Measuring the frequencies of these co-occurrences and calculating
the relative frequencies as approximate probabilities entering in the CHSH inequality, we obtain
manifest violations of the latter for all considered corpuses of documents. In comparing these
violations with those analogously obtained in an earlier work for the same combined concepts in
psychological coincidence experiments with human participants, also violating the CHSH inequality,
we identify the entanglement as being carried by the meaning connection between the two considered
concepts within the combination they form. We explain the stronger violation for the corpuses of
documents, as compared to the violation in the psychology experiments, as being due to the superior
meaning domain of the human mind and, on the other side, to the latter reaching a broader domain of
meaning and being possibly also actively influenced during the experimentation. We mention some
of the issues to be analyzed in future work such as the violations of the CHSH inequality being larger
than the `Cirel'son bound' for all of the considered corpuses of documents.
