In Packet Scheduling with Adversarial Jamming packets of arbitrary sizes arrive over time to be
transmitted over a channel in which instantaneous jamming errors occur at times chosen by the adversary
and not known to the algorithm. The transmission taking place at the time of jamming is corrupt, and
the algorithm learns this fact immediately. An online algorithm maximizes the total size of packets
it successfully transmits and the goal is to develop an algorithm with the lowest possible asymptotic
competitive ratio, where the additive constant may depend on packet sizes. Our main contribution
is a universal algorithm that works for any speedup and packet sizes and, unlike previous algorithms
for the problem, it does not need to know these properties in advance. We show that this algorithm
guarantees 1-competitiveness with speedup 4, making it the first known algorithm to maintain 1-competitiveness
with a moderate speedup in the general setting of arbitrary packet sizes. We also prove a lower bound
of $\phi+1\approx 2.618$ on the speedup of any 1-competitive deterministic algorithm, showing
that our algorithm is close to the optimum. Additionally, we formulate a general framework for analyzing
our algorithm locally and use it to show upper bounds on its competitive ratio for speedups in $[1,4)$
and for several special cases, recovering some previously known results, each of which had a dedicated
proof. In particular, our algorithm is 3-competitive without speedup, matching both the (worst-case)
performance of the algorithm by Jurdzinski et al. and the lower bound by Anta et al.
