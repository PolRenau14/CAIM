Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications which essentially employ directional antennas find
applications spanning from indoor short range wireless personal area networks to outdoor cellular
networks. A thorough understanding of mmWave signal propagation through the wireless channel
provides valuable insights for the design of such networks which in turn dictates the achievable
performance limits. High path loss, penetration loss, and negligible signal scattering are certain
distinctive features of the mmWave channel which necessitates the development of new mathematical
models. Importantly, the impact of directional antennas which spatially filter multi-path components
needs to be embodied as an integral part of the channel model. In this paper, we model outdoor directional
non-line-of-sight mmWave channels using a combination of stochastic geometry and image theory
by expressing channel parameters as joint functions of transmitter-receiver separation distance,
antenna half power beamwidth, and antenna beam pointing direction. By approximating the signal
propagation path due to first and second order reflections from buildings, closed form analytical
expressions for average number of first order reflection components, path loss, and root-mean
square delay spread of channel are derived. The accuracy of the model is verified by comparing numerically
obtained results with experimental data reported by various urban outdoor peer-to-peer mmWave
measurements, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed analytical model for performance
evaluation of mmWave communication networks.
