Motivation: Drug discovery demands rapid quantification of compound-protein interaction (CPI).
However, there is a lack of methods that can predict compound-protein affinity from sequences alone
with high applicability, accuracy, and interpretability. Results: We present a seamless integration
of domain knowledges and learning-based approaches. Under novel representations of structurally-annotated
protein sequences, a semi-supervised deep learning model that unifies recurrent and convolutional
neural networks has been proposed to exploit both unlabeled and labeled data, for jointly encoding
molecular representations and predicting affinities. Our representations and models outperform
conventional options in achieving relative error in IC$_{50}$ within 5-fold for test cases and
20-fold for protein classes not included for training. Performances for new protein classes with
few labeled data are further improved by transfer learning. Furthermore, separate and joint attention
mechanisms are developed and embedded to our model to add to its interpretability, as illustrated
in case studies for predicting and explaining selective drug-target interactions. Lastly, alternative
representations using protein sequences or compound graphs and a unified RNN/GCNN-CNN model using
graph CNN (GCNN) are also explored to reveal algorithmic challenges ahead. Availability: Data
