People are shifting from traditional news sources to online news at an incredibly fast rate. However,
the technology behind online news consumption promotes content that confirms the users' existing
point of view. This phenomenon has led to polarization of opinions and intolerance towards opposing
views. Thus, a key problem is to model information filter bubbles on social media and design methods
to eliminate them. In this paper, we use a machine-learning approach to learn a liberal-conservative
ideology space on Twitter, and show how we can use the learned latent space to tackle the filter bubble
problem. We model the problem of learning the liberal-conservative ideology space of social media
users and media sources as a constrained non-negative matrix-factorization problem. Our model
incorporates the social-network structure and content-consumption information in a joint factorization
problem with shared latent factors. We validate our model and solution on a real-world Twitter dataset
consisting of controversial topics, and show that we are able to separate users by ideology with
over 90% purity. When applied to media sources, our approach estimates ideology scores that are
highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.9) with ground-truth ideology scores. Finally, we demonstrate
the utility of our model in real-world scenarios, by illustrating how the learned ideology latent
space can be used to develop exploratory and interactive interfaces that can help users in diffusing
their information filter bubble.
