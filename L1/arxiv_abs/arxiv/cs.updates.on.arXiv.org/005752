Vascular tracking of angiographic image sequences is one of the most clinically important tasks
in the diagnostic assessment and interventional guidance of cardiac disease. However, this task
can be challenging to accomplish because of unsatisfactory angiography image quality and complex
vascular structures. Thus, this study proposed a new greedy graph search-based method for vascular
tracking. Each vascular branch is separated from the vasculature and is tracked independently.
Then, all branches are combined using topology optimization, thereby resulting in complete vasculature
tracking. A gray-based image registration method was applied to determine the tracking range,
and the deformation field between two consecutive frames was calculated. The vascular branch was
described using a vascular centerline extraction method with multi-probability fusion-based
topology optimization. We introduce an undirected acyclic graph establishment technique. A greedy
search method was proposed to acquire all possible paths in the graph that might match the tracked
vascular branch. The final tracking result was selected by branch matching using dynamic time warping
with a DAISY descriptor. The solution to the problem reflected both the spatial and textural information
between successive frames. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method was effective
and robust for vascular tracking, attaining a F1 score of 0.89 on a single branch dataset and 0.88
on a vessel tree dataset. This approach provided a universal solution to address the problem of filamentary
structure tracking.
