Deep neural networks are applied to a wide range of problems in recent years. In this work, Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) is applied to the problem of determining the depth from a single camera image
(monocular depth). Eight different networks are designed to perform depth estimation, each of
them suitable for a feature level. Networks with different pooling sizes determine different feature
levels. After designing a set of networks, these models may be combined into a single network topology
using graph optimization techniques. This "Semi Parallel Deep Neural Network (SPDNN)" eliminates
duplicated common network layers, and can be further optimized by retraining to achieve an improved
model compared to the individual topologies. In this study, four SPDNN models are trained and have
been evaluated at 2 stages on the KITTI dataset. The ground truth images in the first part of the experiment
are provided by the benchmark, and for the second part, the ground truth images are the depth map results
from applying a state-of-the-art stereo matching method. The results of this evaluation demonstrate
that using post-processing techniques to refine the target of the network increases the accuracy
of depth estimation on individual mono images. The second evaluation shows that using segmentation
data alongside the original data as the input can improve the depth estimation results to a point
where performance is comparable with stereo depth estimation. The computational time is also discussed
in this study.
