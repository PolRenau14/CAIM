Malware analysis and detection techniques have been evolving during the last decade as a reflection
to development of different malware techniques to evade network-based and host-based security
protections. The fast growth in variety and number of malware species made it very difficult for
forensics investigators to provide an on time response. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) aided
malware analysis became a necessity to automate different aspects of static and dynamic malware
investigation. We believe that machine learning aided static analysis can be used as a methodological
approach in technical Cyber Threats Intelligence (CTI) rather than resource-consuming dynamic
malware analysis that has been thoroughly studied before. In this paper, we address this research
gap by conducting an in-depth survey of different machine learning methods for classification
of static characteristics of 32-bit malicious Portable Executable (PE32) Windows files and develop
taxonomy for better understanding of these techniques. Afterwards, we offer a tutorial on how different
machine learning techniques can be utilized in extraction and analysis of a variety of static characteristic
of PE binaries and evaluate accuracy and practical generalization of these techniques. Finally,
the results of experimental study of all the method using common data was given to demonstrate the
accuracy and complexity. This paper may serve as a stepping stone for future researchers in cross-disciplinary
field of machine learning aided malware forensics.
