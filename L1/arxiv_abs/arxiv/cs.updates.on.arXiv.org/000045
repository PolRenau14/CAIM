With recent advances in sensing and tracking technology, trajectory data is becoming increasingly
pervasive and analysis of trajectory data is becoming exceedingly important. A fundamental problem
in analyzing trajectory data is that of identifying common patterns between pairs or among groups
of trajectories. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying similar portions between
a pair of trajectories, each observed as a sequence of points sampled from it. We present new measures
of trajectory similarity --- both local and global --- between a pair of trajectories to distinguish
between similar and dissimilar portions. Our model is robust under noise and outliers, it does not
make any assumptions on the sampling rates on either trajectory, and it works even if they are partially
observed. Additionally, the model also yields a scalar similarity score which can be used to rank
multiple pairs of trajectories according to similarity, e.g. in clustering applications. We also
present efficient algorithms for computing the similarity under our measures; the worst-case
running time is quadratic in the number of sample points. Finally, we present an extensive experimental
study evaluating the effectiveness of our approach on real datasets, comparing with it with earlier
approaches, and illustrating many issues that arise in trajectory data. Our experiments show that
our approach is highly accurate in distinguishing similar and dissimilar portions as compared
to earlier methods even with sparse sampling.
