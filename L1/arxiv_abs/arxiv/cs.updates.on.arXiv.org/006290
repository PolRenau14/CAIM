Purpose: The class of models that can be represented by STL files is larger than the class of models
that can be printed using additive manufacturing technologies. Stated differently, there exist
well-formed STL files that cannot be printed. In this paper such a gap is formalized and a fully automatic
procedure is described to turn any such file into a printable model. Approach: Based on well-established
concepts from combinatorial topology, we provide an unambiguous description of all the mathematical
entities involved in the modeling-printing pipeline. Specifically, we formally define the conditions
that an STL file must satisfy to be printable and, based on these, we design an as-exact-as-possible
repairing algorithm. Findings: We have found that, in order to cope with all the possible triangle
configurations, the algorithm must distinguish between triangles that bound solid parts and triangles
that constitute zero-thickness sheets. Only the former set can be fixed without distortion. Originality:
Previous methods that are guaranteed to fix all the possible configurations provide only approximate
solutions with an unnecessary distortion. Conversely, our procedure is as exact as possible, meaning
that no visible distortion is introduced unless it is strictly imposed by limitations of the printing
device. Thanks to such an unprecedented flexibility and accuracy, this algorithm is expected to
significantly simplify the modeling-printing process, in particular within the continuously
emerging non-professional "maker" communities.
