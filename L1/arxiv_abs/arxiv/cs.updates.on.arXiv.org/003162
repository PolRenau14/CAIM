Fine-grained object recognition that aims to identify the type of an object among a large number
of subcategories is an emerging application with the increasing resolution that exposes new details
in image data. Traditional fully supervised algorithms fail to handle this problem where there
is low between-class variance and high within-class variance for the classes of interest with small
sample sizes. We study an even more extreme scenario named zero-shot learning (ZSL) in which no training
example exists for some of the classes. ZSL aims to build a recognition model for new unseen categories
by relating them to seen classes that were previously learned. We establish this relation by learning
a compatibility function between image features extracted via a convolutional neural network
and auxiliary information that describes the semantics of the classes of interest by using training
samples from the seen classes. Then, we show how knowledge transfer can be performed for the unseen
classes by maximizing this function during inference. We introduce a new data set that contains
40 different types of street trees in 1-ft spatial resolution aerial data, and evaluate the performance
of this model with manually annotated attributes, a natural language model, and a scientific taxonomy
as auxiliary information. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves 14.3% recognition
accuracy for the classes with no training examples, which is significantly better than a random
guess accuracy of 6.3% for 16 test classes, and three other ZSL algorithms.
