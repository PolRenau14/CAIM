Cultural heritage is the asset of all the peoples of the world. The preservation and inheritance
of cultural heritage is conducive to the progress of human civilization. In northwestern China,
there is a world heritage site -- Mogao Grottoes -- that has a plenty of mural paintings showing the
historical cultures of ancient China. To study these historical cultures, one critical procedure
is to date the mural paintings, i.e., determining the era when they were created. Until now, most
mural paintings at Mogao Grottoes have been dated by directly referring to the mural texts or historical
documents. However, some are still left with creation-era undetermined due to the lack of reference
materials. Considering that the drawing style of mural paintings was changing along the history
and the drawing style can be learned and quantified through painting data, we formulate the problem
of mural-painting dating into a problem of drawing-style classification. In fact, drawing styles
can be expressed not only in color or curvature, but also in some unknown forms -- the forms that have
not been observed. To this end, besides sophisticated color and shape descriptors, a deep convolution
neural network is designed to encode the implicit drawing styles. 3860 mural paintings collected
from 194 different grottoes with determined creation-era labels are used to train the classification
model and build the dating method. In experiments, the proposed dating method is applied to seven
mural paintings which were previously dated with controversies, and the exciting new dating results
are approved by the Dunhuang expert.
