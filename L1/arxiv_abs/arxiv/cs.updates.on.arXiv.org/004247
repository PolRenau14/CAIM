Common medical conditions are often associated with sleep abnormalities. Patients with medical
disorders often suffer from poor sleep quality compared to healthy individuals, which in turn may
worsen the symptoms of the disorder. Accurate detection of sleep/wake patterns is important in
developing personalized digital markers, which can be used for objective measurements and efficient
disease management. Big Data technologies and advanced analytics methods hold the promise to revolutionize
clinical research processes, enabling the effective blending of digital data into clinical trials.
Actigraphy, a non-invasive activity monitoring method is heavily used to detect and evaluate activities
and movement disorders, and assess sleep/wake behavior. In order to study the connection between
sleep/wake patterns and a cluster headache disorder, activity data was collected using a wearable
device in the course of a clinical trial. This study presents two novel modeling schemes that utilize
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify sleep/wake states. The proposed methods
are a sequential CNN, reminiscent of the bi-directional CNN for slot filling, and a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) based model. Furthermore, we expand standard "Sleep" and "Wake" activity states space by
adding the "Falling asleep" and "Siesta" states. We show that the proposed methods provide promising
results in accurate detection of the expanded sleep/wake states. Finally, we explore the relations
between the detected sleep/wake patterns and onset of cluster headache attacks, and present preliminary
observations.
