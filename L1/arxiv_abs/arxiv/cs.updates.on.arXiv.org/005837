We have previously shown how to socially integrate a fish robot into a group of zebrafish thanks to
biomimetic behavioural models. The models have to be calibrated on experimental data to present
correct behavioural features. This calibration is essential to enhance the social integration
of the robot into the group. When calibrated, the behavioural model of fish behaviour is implemented
to drive a robot with closed-loop control of social interactions into a group of zebrafish. This
approach can be useful to form mixed-groups, and study animal individual and collective behaviour
by using biomimetic autonomous robots capable of responding to the animals in long-standing experiments.
Here, we show a methodology for continuous real-time calibration and refinement of multi-level
behavioural model. The real-time calibration, by an evolutionary algorithm, is based on simulation
of the model to correspond to the observed fish behaviour in real-time. The calibrated model is updated
on the robot and tested during the experiments. This method allows to cope with changes of dynamics
in fish behaviour. Moreover, each fish presents individual behavioural differences. Thus, each
trial is done with naive fish groups that display behavioural variability. This real-time calibration
methodology can optimise the robot behaviours during the experiments. Our implementation of this
methodology runs on three different computers that perform individual tracking, data-analysis,
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, simulation of the fish robot and adaptation of the robot
behavioural models, all in real-time.
