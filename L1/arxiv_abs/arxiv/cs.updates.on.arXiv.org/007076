We study the impact of signal jamming attacks against the communication based train control (CBTC)
systems and develop the countermeasures to limit the attacks' impact. CBTC supports the train operation
automation and moving-block signaling, which improves the transport efficiency. We consider
an attacker jamming the wireless communication between the trains or the train to wayside access
point, which can disable CBTC and the corresponding benefits. In contrast to prior work studying
jamming only at the physical or link layer, we study the real impact of such attacks on end users, namely
train journey time and passenger congestion. Our analysis employs a detailed model of leaky medium-based
communication system (leaky waveguide or leaky feeder/coaxial cable) popularly used in CBTC systems.
To counteract the jamming attacks, we develop a mitigation approach based on frequency hopping
spread spectrum taking into account domain-specific structure of the leaky-medium CBTC systems.
Specifically, compared with existing implementations of FHSS, we apply FHSS not only between the
transmitter-receiver pair but also at the track-side repeaters. To demonstrate the feasibility
of implementing this technology in CBTC systems, we develop a FHSS repeater prototype using software-defined
radios on both leaky-medium and open-air (free-wave) channels. We perform extensive simulations
driven by realistic running profiles of trains and real-world passenger data to provide insights
into the jamming attack's impact and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.
