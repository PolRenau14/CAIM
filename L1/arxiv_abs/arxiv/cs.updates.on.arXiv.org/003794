As a representative sequential pattern mining problem, counting the frequency of serial episodes
from a streaming sequence has drawn continuous attention in academia due to its wide application
in practice, e.g., telecommunication alarms, stock market, transaction logs, bioinformatics,
etc. Although a number of serial episodes mining algorithms have been developed recently, most
of them are neither stream-oriented, as they require multi-pass of dataset, nor time-aware, as
they fail to take into account the time constraint of serial episodes. In this paper, we propose two
novel one-pass algorithms, ONCE and ONCE+, each of which can respectively compute two popular frequencies
of given episodes satisfying predefined time-constraint as signals in a stream arrives one-after-another.
ONCE is only used for non-overlapped frequency where the occurrences of a serial episode in sequence
are not intersected. ONCE+ is designed for the distinct frequency where the occurrences of a serial
episode do not share any event. Theoretical study proves that our algorithm can correctly mine the
frequency of target time constraint serial episodes in a given stream. Experimental study over
both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can work, with
little time and space, in signal-intensive streams where millions of signals arrive within a single
second. Moreover, the algorithm has been applied in a real stream processing system, where the efficacy
and efficiency of this work is tested in practical applications.
