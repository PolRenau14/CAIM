Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems composed by a physical component that is controlled or
monitored by a cyber-component, a computer-based algorithm. Advances in CPS technologies and
science are enabling capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security,
and usability that will far exceed the simple embedded systems of today. CPS technologies are transforming
the way people interact with engineered systems. New smart CPS are driving innovation in various
sectors such as agriculture, energy, transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. They are
leading the 4-th Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) that is having benefits thanks to the high
flexibility of production. The Industry 4.0 production paradigm is characterized by high intercommunicating
properties of its production elements in all the manufacturing processes. This is the reason it
is a core concept how the systems should be structurally optimized to have the adequate level of redundancy
to be satisfactorily resilient. This goal can benefit from formal methods well known in various
scientific domains such as artificial intelligence. So, the current research concerns the proposal
of a CPS meta-model and its instantiation. In this way it lists all kind of relationships that may
occur between the CPSs themselves and between their (cyber-and physical-) components. Using the
CPS meta-model formalization, with an adaptation of the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formal approach,
this paper presents a way to optimize the modelling of CPS systems emphasizing their redundancy
and their resiliency.
