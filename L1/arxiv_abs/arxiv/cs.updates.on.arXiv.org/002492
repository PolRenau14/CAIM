Cities across the United States are undergoing great transformation and urban growth. Data and
data analysis has become an essential element of urban planning as cities use data to plan land use
and development. One great challenge is to use the tools of data science to promote equity along with
growth. The city of Atlanta is an example site of large-scale urban renewal that aims to engage in
development without displacement. On the Westside of downtown Atlanta, the construction of the
new Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the conversion of an underutilized rail-line into a multi-use trail
may result in increased property values. In response to community residents' concerns and a commitment
to development without displacement, the city and philanthropic partners announced an Anti-Displacement
Tax Fund to subsidize future property tax increases of owner occupants for the next twenty years.
To achieve greater transparency, accountability, and impact, residents expressed a desire for
a tool that would help them determine eligibility and quantify this commitment. In support of this
goal, we use machine learning techniques to analyze historical tax assessment and predict future
tax assessments. We then apply eligibility estimates to our predictions to estimate the total cost
for the first seven years of the program. These forecasts are also incorporated into an interactive
tool for community residents to determine their eligibility for the fund and the expected increase
in their home value over the next seven years.
