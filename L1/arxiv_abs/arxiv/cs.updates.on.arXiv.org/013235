Many applications require a camera to be relocalised online, without expensive offline training
on the target scene. Whilst both keyframe and sparse keypoint matching methods can be used online,
the former often fail away from the training trajectory, and the latter can struggle in textureless
regions. By contrast, scene coordinate regression (SCoRe) methods generalise to novel poses and
can leverage dense correspondences to improve robustness, and recent work has shown how to adapt
SCoRe forests between scenes, allowing their state-of-the-art performance to be leveraged online.
However, because they use features hand-crafted for indoor use, they do not generalise well to harder
outdoor scenes. Whilst replacing the forest with a neural network and learning suitable features
for outdoor use is possible, the techniques used to adapt forests between scenes are unfortunately
harder to transfer to a network context. In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel way of
leveraging a network trained on one scene to predict points in another scene. Our approach replaces
the appearance clustering performed by the branching structure of a regression forest with a two-step
process that first uses the network to predict points in the original scene, and then uses these predicted
points to look up clusters of points from the new scene. We show experimentally that our online approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets,
whilst running in under 300ms, making it highly effective in live scenarios.
