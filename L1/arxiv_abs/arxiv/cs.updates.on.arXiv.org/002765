In this paper we revisit the classical Edge Disjoint Paths (EDP) problem, where one is given an undirected
graph G and a set of terminal pairs P and asks whether G contains a set of pairwise edge-disjoint paths
connecting every terminal pair in P. Our focus lies on structural parameterizations for the problem
that allow for efficient (polynomial-time or fpt) algorithms. As our first result, we answer an
open question stated in Fleszar, Mnich, and Spoerhase (2016), by showing that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time if the input graph has a feedback vertex set of size one. We also show that
EDP parameterized by the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph is fixed-parameter
tractable. Having developed two novel algorithms for EDP using structural restrictions on the
input graph, we then turn our attention towards the augmented graph, i.e., the graph obtained from
the input graph after adding one edge between every terminal pair. In constrast to the input graph,
where EDP is known to remain NP-hard even for treewidth two, a result by Zhou et al. (2000) shows that
EDP can be solved in non-uniform polynomial time if the augmented graph has constant treewidth;
we note that the possible improvement of this result to an fpt-algorithm has remained open since
then. We show that this is highly unlikely by establishing the W[1]-hardness of the problem parameterized
by the treewidth (and even feedback vertex set) of the augmented graph. Finally, we develop an fpt-algorithm
for EDP by exploiting a novel structural parameter of the augmented graph.
