From very recent studies, the area spectral efficiency (ASE) performance of downlink (DL) cellular
networks will continuously decrease and finally to zero with the network densification in a fully
loaded ultra-dense network (UDN) when the absolute height difference between a base station (BS)
antenna and a user equipment (UE) antenna is larger than zero, which is referred as the ASE Crash.
We revisit this issue by considering the impact of the BS antenna downtilt on the downlink network
capacity. In general, there exists a height difference between a BS and a UE in practical networks.
It is common to utilize antenna downtilt to adjust the direction of the vertical antenna pattern,
and thus increase received signal power or reduce inter-cell interference power to improve network
performance. This paper focuses on investigating the relationship between the base station antenna
downtilt and the downlink network capacity in terms of the coverage probability and the ASE. The
analytical results of the coverage probability and the ASE are derived, and we find that there exists
an optimal antenna downtilt to achieve the maximal coverage probability for each base station density.
Moreover, we derive numerically solvable expressions for the optimal antenna downtilt, which
is a function of the base station density. Our theoretical and numerical results show that after
applying the optimal antenna downtilt, the network performance can be improved significantly.
Specifically, with the optimal antenna downtilt, the ASE crash can be delayed by nearly one order
of magnitude in terms of the base station density.
