The measurement error with normal distribution is universal in applications. Generally, smaller
measurement error requires better instrument and higher test cost. In decision making based on
attribute values of objects, we shall select an attribute subset with appropriate measurement
error to minimize the total test cost. Recently, error-range-based covering rough set with uniform
distribution error was proposed to investigate this issue. However, the measurement errors satisfy
normal distribution instead of uniform distribution which is rather simple for most applications.
In this paper, we introduce normal distribution measurement errors to covering-based rough set
model, and deal with test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction problem in this new model. The major
contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, we build a new data model based on normal distribution
measurement errors. With the new data model, the error range is an ellipse in a two-dimension space.
Second, the covering-based rough set with normal distribution measurement errors is constructed
through the "3-sigma" rule. Third, the test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction problem is redefined
on this covering-based rough set. Fourth, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to deal with this problem.
The algorithm is tested on ten UCI (University of California - Irvine) datasets. The experimental
results show that the algorithm is more effective and efficient than the existing one. This study
is a step toward realistic applications of cost-sensitive learning.
