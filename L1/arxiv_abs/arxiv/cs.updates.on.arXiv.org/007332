Code analyzers such as Error Prone and FindBugs detect code patterns symptomatic of bugs, performance
issues, or bad style. These tools express patterns as quick fixes that detect and rewrite unwanted
code. However, it is difficult to come up with new quick fixes and decide which ones are useful and
frequently appear in real code. We propose to rely on the collective wisdom of programmers and learn
quick fixes from revision histories in software repositories. We present REVISAR, a tool for discovering
common Java edit patterns in code repositories. Given code repositories and their revision histories,
REVISAR (i) identifies code edits from revisions and (ii) clusters edits into sets that can be described
using an edit pattern. The designers of code analyzers can then inspect the patterns and add the corresponding
quick fixes to their tools. We ran REVISAR on nine popular GitHub projects, and it discovered 89 useful
edit patterns that appeared in 3 or more projects. Moreover, 64% of the discovered patterns did not
appear in existing tools. We then conducted a survey with 164 programmers from 124 projects and found
that programmers significantly preferred eight out of the nine of the discovered patterns. Finally,
we submitted 16 pull requests applying our patterns to 9 projects and, at the time of the writing,
programmers accepted 6 (60%) of them. The results of this work aid toolsmiths in discovering quick
fixes and making informed decisions about which quick fixes to prioritize based on patterns programmers
actually apply in practice.
