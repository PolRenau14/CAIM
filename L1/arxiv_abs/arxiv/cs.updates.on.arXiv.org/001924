The bipartite graph is a ubiquitous data structure that can model the relationship between two entity
types: for instance, users and items, queries and webpages. In this paper, we study the problem of
ranking vertices of a bipartite graph, based on the graph's link structure as well as prior information
about vertices (which we term a query vector). We present a new solution, BiRank, which iteratively
assigns scores to vertices and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking. In contrast to
the traditional random walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization
function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector. Importantly, we establish
how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology, enabling the future extension in a probabilistic
way. To show the rationale and extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to
rank for the more generic n-partite graphs. BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph structure
and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses flexibly. To illustrate its
functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank (ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two
real-world applications: a general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items,
and a personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate BiRank's soundness (fast convergence),
efficiency (linear in the number of graph edges) and effectiveness (achieving state-of-the-art
in the two real-world tasks).
