Anterior Vertebral Body Growth Modulation (AVBGM) is a minimally invasive surgical technique
that gradually corrects spine deformities while preserving lumbar motion. However the selection
of potential surgical patients is currently based on clinical judgment and would be facilitated
by the identification of patients responding to AVBGM prior to surgery. We introduce a statistical
framework for predicting the surgical outcomes following AVBGM in adolescents with idiopathic
scoliosis. A discriminant manifold is first constructed to maximize the separation between responsive
and non-responsive groups of patients treated with AVBGM for scoliosis. The model then uses subject-specific
correction trajectories based on articulated transformations in order to map spine correction
profiles to a group-average piecewise-geodesic path. Spine correction trajectories are described
in a piecewise-geodesic fashion to account for varying times at follow-up exams, regressing the
curve via a quadratic optimization process. To predict the evolution of correction, a baseline
reconstruction is projected onto the manifold, from which a spatiotemporal regression model is
built from parallel transport curves inferred from neighboring exemplars. The model was trained
on 438 reconstructions and tested on 56 subjects using 3D spine reconstructions from follow-up
exams, with the probabilistic framework yielding accurate results with differences of 2.1 +/-
0.6deg in main curve angulation, and generating models similar to biomechanical simulations.
