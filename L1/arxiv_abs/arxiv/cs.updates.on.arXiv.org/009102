We consider the problem in precision health of grouping people into subpopulations based on their
degree of vulnerability to a risk factor. These subpopulations cannot be discovered with traditional
clustering techniques because their quality is evaluated with a supervised metric: the ease of
modeling a response variable over observations within them. Instead, we apply the supervised cadre
model (SCM), which does use this metric. We extend the SCM formalism so that it may be applied to multivariate
regression and binary classification problems. We also develop a way to use conditional entropy
to assess the confidence in the process by which a subject is assigned their cadre. Using the SCM,
we generalize the environment-wide association study (EWAS) workflow to be able to model heterogeneity
in population risk. In our EWAS, we consider more than two hundred environmental exposure factors
and find their association with diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and hypertension.
This requires adapting the SCM to be applicable to data generated by a complex survey design. After
correcting for false positives, we found 25 exposure variables that had a significant association
with at least one of our response variables. Eight of these were significant for a discovered subpopulation
but not for the overall population. Some of these associations have been identified by previous
researchers, while others appear to be novel. We examine several discovered subpopulations in
detail, and we find that they are interpretable and that they suggest further research questions.
