Manifest contract calculi, which integrate cast-based dynamic contract checking and refinement
type systems, have been studied as foundations for hybrid contract checking. In this article, we
study techniques to reasoning about a polymorphic manifest contract calculus, including a few
program transformations related to static contract verification. We first define a polymorphic
manifest contract calculus $\mathrm{F}_{H}$, which is much simpler than a previously studied
one with delayed substitution, and a logical relation for it and prove that the logical relation
is sound with respect to contextual equivalence. Next, we show that the upcast elimination property,
which has been studied as correctness of subtyping-based static cast verification, holds for $\mathrm{F}_{H}$.
More specifically, we give a subtyping relation (which is not part of the calculus) for $\mathrm{F}_{H}$
types and prove that a term obtained by eliminating upcasts---casts from one type to a supertype
of it---is logically related and so contextually equivalent to the original one. We also justify
two other program transformations for casts: selfification and static cast decomposition, which
help upcast elimination. A challenge is that, due to the subsumption-free approach to manifest
contracts, these program transformations do not always preserve well-typedness of terms. To address
it, the logical relation and contextual equivalence in this work are defined as semityped relations:
only one side of the relations is required to be well typed and the other side may be ill typed.
