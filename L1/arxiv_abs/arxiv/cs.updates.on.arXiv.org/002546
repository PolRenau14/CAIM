This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of economic and pricing
theory for resource management in the evolving fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. The 5G
wireless networks are envisioned to overcome existing limitations of cellular networks in terms
of data rate, capacity, latency, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, coverage, reliability,
and cost per information transfer. To achieve the goals, the 5G systems will adopt emerging technologies
such as massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), mmWave communications, and dense Heterogeneous
Networks (HetNets). However, 5G involves multiple entities and stakeholders that may have different
objectives, e.g., high data rate, low latency, utility maximization, and revenue/profit maximization.
This poses a number of challenges to resource management designs of 5G. While the traditional solutions
may neither efficient nor applicable, economic and pricing models have been recently developed
and adopted as useful tools to achieve the objectives. In this paper, we review economic and pricing
approaches proposed to address resource management issues in the 5G wireless networks including
user association, spectrum allocation, and interference and power management. Furthermore,
we present applications of economic and pricing models for wireless caching and mobile data offloading.
Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying
economic and pricing models to the 5G wireless networks.
