Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead
of standard intensity frames. These cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have a very high dynamic
range, which enables them to provide reliable visual information during high speed motions or in
scenes characterized by high dynamic range. However, event cameras output only little information
when the amount of motion is limited, such as in the case of almost still motion. Conversely, standard
cameras provide instant and rich information about the environment most of the time (in low-speed
and good lighting scenarios), but they fail severely in case of fast motions, or difficult lighting
such as high dynamic range or low light scenes. In this paper, we present the first state estimation
pipeline that leverages the complementary advantages of these two sensors by fusing in a tightly-coupled
manner events, standard frames, and inertial measurements. We show on the publicly available Event
Camera Dataset that our hybrid pipeline leads to an accuracy improvement of 130% over event-only
pipelines, and 85% over standard-frames-only visual-inertial systems, while still being computationally
tractable. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to demonstrate - to the best of our knowledge - the first
autonomous quadrotor flight using an event camera for state estimation, unlocking flight scenarios
that were not reachable with traditional visual-inertial odometry, such as low-light environments
and high-dynamic range scenes.
