Given a stream $S = (s_1, s_2, ..., s_N)$, a $\phi$-heavy hitter is an item $s_i$ that occurs at least
$\phi N$ times in $S$. The problem of finding heavy-hitters has been extensively studied in the database
literature. In this paper, we study a related problem. We say that there is a $\phi$-event at time
$t$ if $s_t$ occurs exactly $\phi N$ times in $(s_1, s_2, ..., s_t)$. Thus, for each $\phi$-heavy
hitter there is a single $\phi$-event which occurs when its count reaches the reporting threshold
$\phi N$. We define the online event-detection problem (OEDP) as: given $\phi$ and a stream $S$,
report all $\phi$-events as soon as they occur. Many real-world monitoring systems demand event
detection where all events must be reported (no false negatives), in a timely manner, with no non-events
reported (no false positives), and a low reporting threshold. As a result, the OEDP requires a large
amount of space (Omega(N) words) and is not solvable in the streaming model or via standard sampling-based
approaches. Since OEDP requires large space, we focus on cache-efficient algorithms in the external-memory
model. We provide algorithms for the OEDP that are within a log factor of optimal. Our algorithms
are tunable: its parameters can be set to allow for a bounded false-positives and a bounded delay
in reporting. None of our relaxations allow false negatives since reporting all events is a strict
requirement of our applications. Finally, we show improved results when the count of items in the
input stream follows a power-law distribution.
