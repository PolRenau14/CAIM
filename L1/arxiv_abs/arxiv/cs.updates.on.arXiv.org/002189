Opportunistic networks (OppNets) are focused to exploit direct, localised communications which
occur in a peer-to-peer manner mostly based on people's movements and their contact durations.
Therefore, the use of realistic mobility models is critical to evaluate the data dissemination
in OppNets. One of the mobility models that is available in OMNeT++ which can be used to mimic human
movement patterns is Small Worlds in Motion (SWIM). The SWIM model is based on the intuition that
humans often visit nearby locations and if the visited location is far away, then it is probably due
to the popularity of the location. As an alternative to mobility of a node, pairwise contact probabilities
are also used to evaluate the data dissemination in OppNets. Pairwise contact probabilities can
be used to predict that a node will be met by a particular node. These probabilities can be derived
in many ways. One of the ways is to calculate the average probability with which a node will meet another
particular node at any point of time. Another way is to calculate the probability with which a node
will meet another based on the time of day. The way of calculating pairwise contact probability depends
on the scenario. In this work, the pairwise contact probabilities obtained from the real traces
are used to tune the parameters of the SWIM mobility model. The traces and the SWIM model are compared
in terms of contact durations, inter-contact times and, number of pairwise contacts. How to decide
SWIM parameters using real contact traces are being addressed.
