Variations of deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) have been successfully
applied to image denoising. The goal is to automatically learn a mapping from a noisy image to a clean
image given training data consisting of pairs of noisy and clean images. Most existing CNN models
for image denoising have many layers. In such cases, the models involve a large amount of parameters
and are computationally expensive to train. In this paper, we develop a dilated residual CNN for
Gaussian image denoising. Compared with the recently proposed residual denoiser, our method can
achieve comparable performance with less computational cost. Specifically, we enlarge receptive
field by adopting dilated convolution in residual network, and the dilation factor is set to a certain
value. We utilize appropriate zero padding to make the dimension of the output the same as the input.
It has been proven that the expansion of receptive field can boost the CNN performance in image classification,
and we further demonstrate that it can also lead to competitive performance for denoising problem.
Moreover, we present a formula to calculate receptive field size when dilated convolution is incorporated.
Thus, the change of receptive field can be interpreted mathematically. To validate the efficacy
of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments for both gray and color image denoising with specific
or randomized noise levels. Both of the quantitative measurements and the visual results of denoising
are promising comparing with state-of-the-art baselines.
