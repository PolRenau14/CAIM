We consider a dynamical process in a network which distributes all particles (tokens) located at
a node among its neighbors, in a round-robin manner. We show that in the recurrent state of this dynamics
(i.e., disregarding a polynomially long initialization phase of the system), the number of particles
located on a given edge, averaged over an interval of time, is tightly concentrated around the average
particle density in the system. Formally, for a system of $k$ particles in a graph of $m$ edges, during
any interval of length $T$, this time-averaged value is $k/m \pm \widetilde{O}(1/T)$, whenever
$\gcd(m,k) = \widetilde{O}(1)$ (and so, e.g., whenever $m$ is a prime number). To achieve these
bounds, we link the behavior of the studied dynamics to ergodic properties of traversals based on
Eulerian circuits on a symmetric directed graph. These results are proved through sum set methods
and are likely to be of independent interest. As a corollary, we also obtain bounds on the \emph{idleness}
of the studied dynamics, i.e., on the longest possible time between two consecutive appearances
of a token on an edge, taken over all edges. Designing trajectories for $k$ tokens in a way which minimizes
idleness is fundamental to the study of the patrolling problem in networks. Our results immediately
imply a bound of $\widetilde{O}(m/k)$ on the idleness of the studied process, showing that it is
a distributed $\widetilde{O}(1)$-competitive solution to the patrolling task, for all of the
covered cases. Our work also provides some further insights that may be interesting in load-balancing
applications.
