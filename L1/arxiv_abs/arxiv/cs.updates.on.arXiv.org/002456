Brascamp-Lieb inequality is an important mathematical tool in analysis, geometry and information
theory. There are various ways to prove Brascamp-Lieb inequality such as heat flow method, Brownian
motion and subadditivity of the entropy. While Brascamp-Lieb inequality is originally stated
in Euclidean Space, discussed Brascamp-Lieb inequality for discrete Abelian group and discussed
Brascamp-Lieb inequality for Markov semigroups. Many mathematical inequalities can be formulated
as algebraic inequalities which asserts some given polynomial is nonnegative. In 1927, Artin proved
that any non- negative polynomial can be represented as a sum of squares of rational functions, which
can be further formulated as a polynomial certificate of the nonnegativity of the polynomial. This
is a Sum of Square proof of the inequality. Take the degree of the polynomial certificate as the degree
of Sum of Square proof. The degree of an Sum of Square proof determines the complexity of generating
such proof by Sum of Square algorithm which is a powerful tool for optimization and computer aided
proof. In this paper, we give a Sum of Square proof for some special settings of Brascamp- Lieb inequality
following and and discuss some applications of Brascamp-Lieb inequality on Abelian group and Euclidean
Sphere. If the original description of the inequality has constant degree and d is constant, the
degree of the proof is also constant. Therefore, low degree sum of square algorithm can fully capture
the power of low degree finite Brascamp-Lieb inequality.
