Optical coherence tomography (OCT) based measurements of retinal layer thickness, such as the
retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell with inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) are commonly
used for the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. Previously, machine learning techniques have
utilized segmentation-based imaging features such as the peripapillary RNFL thickness and the
cup-to-disc ratio. Here, we propose a deep learning technique that classifies eyes as healthy or
glaucomatous directly from raw, unsegmented OCT volumes of the optic nerve head (ONH) using a 3D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We compared the accuracy of this technique with various feature-based
machine learning algorithms and demonstrated the superiority of the proposed deep learning based
method. Logistic regression was found to be the best performing classical machine learning technique
with an AUC of 0.89. In direct comparison, the deep learning approach achieved a substantially higher
AUC of 0.94 with the additional advantage of providing insight into which regions of an OCT volume
are important for glaucoma detection. Computing Class Activation Maps (CAM), we found that the
CNN identified neuroretinal rim and optic disc cupping as well as the lamina cribrosa (LC) and its
surrounding areas as the regions significantly associated with the glaucoma classification.
These regions anatomically correspond to the well established and commonly used clinical markers
for glaucoma diagnosis such as increased cup volume, cup diameter, and neuroretinal rim thinning
at the superior and inferior segments.
