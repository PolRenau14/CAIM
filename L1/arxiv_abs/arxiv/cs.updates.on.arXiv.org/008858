We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem from decentralized uncoded caching
databases. There are two phases in our problem setting, a caching phase, and a retrieval phase. In
the caching phase, a data center containing all the $K$ files, where each file is of size $L$ bits,
and several databases with storage size constraint $\mu K L$ bits exist in the system. Each database
independently chooses $\mu K L$ bits out of the total $KL$ bits from the data center to cache through
the same probability distribution in a decentralized manner. In the retrieval phase, a user (retriever)
accesses $N$ databases in addition to the data center, and wishes to retrieve a desired file privately.
We characterize the optimal normalized download cost to be $\frac{D}{L} = \sum_{n=1}^{N+1} \binom{N}{n-1}
\mu^{n-1} (1-\mu)^{N+1-n} \left( 1+ \frac{1}{n} + \dots+ \frac{1}{n^{K-1}} \right)$. We show
that uniform and random caching scheme which is originally proposed for decentralized coded caching
by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, along with Sun and Jafar retrieval scheme which is originally proposed
for PIR from replicated databases surprisingly result in the lowest normalized download cost.
This is the decentralized counterpart of the recent result of Attia, Kumar and Tandon for the centralized
case. The converse proof contains several ingredients such as interference lower bound, induction
lemma, replacing queries and answering string random variables with the content of distributed
databases, the nature of decentralized uncoded caching databases, and bit marginalization of
joint caching distributions.
