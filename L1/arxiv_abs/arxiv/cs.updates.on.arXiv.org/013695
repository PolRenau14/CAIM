Visualizations rely on highlighting to attract and guide our attention. To make an object of interest
stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has
to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting
technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches,
Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations,
the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable
drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting
technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation
out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume
the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative
evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors
as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average
accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example
application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique,
conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related
design implications.
