Lung cancer is a global and dangerous disease, and its early detection is crucial to reducing the
risks of mortality. In this regard, it has been of great interest in developing a computer-aided
system for pulmonary nodules detection as early as possible on thoracic CT scans. In general, a nodule
detection system involves two steps: (i) candidate nodule detection at a high sensitivity, which
captures many false positives and (ii) false positive reduction from candidates. However, due
to the high variation of nodule morphological characteristics and the possibility of mistaking
them for neighboring organs, candidate nodule detection remains a challenge. In this study, we
propose a novel Multi-scale Gradual Integration Convolutional Neural Network (MGI-CNN), designed
with three main strategies: (1) to use multi-scale inputs with different levels of contextual information,
(2) to use abstract information inherent in different input scales with gradual integration, and
(3) to learn multi-stream feature integration in an end-to-end manner. To verify the efficacy of
the proposed network, we conducted exhaustive experiments on the LUNA16 challenge datasets by
comparing the performance of the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods in the literature.
On two candidate subsets of the LUNA16 dataset, i.e., V1 and V2, our method achieved an average CPM
of 0.908 (V1) and 0.942 (V2), outperforming comparable methods by a large margin. Our MGI-CNN is
implemented in Python using TensorFlow and the source code is available from 'https://github.com/ku-milab/MGICNN.'
