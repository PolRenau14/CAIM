The modeling of networks, specifically generative models, have been shown to provide a plethora
of information about the underlying network structures, as well as many other benefits behind their
construction. Recently there has been a considerable increase in interest for the better understanding
and modeling of networks, but the vast majority of this work has been for unsigned networks. However,
many networks can have positive and negative links(or signed networks), especially in online social
media, and they inherently have properties not found in unsigned networks due to the added complexity.
Specifically, the positive to negative link ratio and the distribution of signed triangles in the
networks are properties that are unique to signed networks and would need to be explicitly modeled.
This is because their underlying dynamics are not random, but controlled by social theories, such
as Structural Balance Theory, which loosely states that users in social networks will prefer triadic
relations that involve less tension. Therefore, we propose a model based on Structural Balance
Theory and the unsigned Transitive Chung-Lu model for the modeling of signed networks. Our model
introduces two parameters that are able to help maintain the positive link ratio and proportion
of balanced triangles. Empirical experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate
the importance of designing models specific to signed networks based on social theories to obtain
better performance in maintaining signed network properties while generating synthetic networks.
