Augmented Reality (AR) systems describe the class of systems that use computers to overlay virtual
information on the real world. AR environments allow the development of promising tools in several
application domains. In medical training and simulation the learning potential of AR is significantly
amplified by the capability of the system to present 3D medical models in real-time at remote locations.
Furthermore the simulation applicability is broadened by the use of real-time deformable medical
models. This work presents a distributed medical training prototype designed to train medical
practitioners' hand-eye coordination when performing endotracheal intubations. The system
we present accomplishes this task with the help of AR paradigms. An extension of this prototype to
medical simulations by employing deformable medical models is possible. The shared state maintenance
of the collaborative AR environment is assured through a novel adaptive synchronization algorithm
(ASA) that increases the sense of presence among participants and facilitates their interactivity
in spite of infrastructure delays. The system will allow paramedics, pre-hospital personnel,
and students to practice their skills without touching a real patient and will provide them with
the visual feedback they could not otherwise obtain. Such a distributed AR training tool has the
potential to: allow an instructor to simultaneously train local and remotely located students
and, allow students to actually "see" the internal anatomy and therefore better understand their
actions on a human patient simulator (HPS).
