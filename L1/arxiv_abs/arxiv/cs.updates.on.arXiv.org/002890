In pervasive computing environment, Location Based Services (LBSs) are getting popularity among
users because of their usefulness in day-to-day life. LBSs are information services that use geospatial
data of mobile device and smart phone users to provide information, entertainment and security
in real time. A key concern in such pervasive computing environment is the need to reveal the user's
exact location which may allow an adversary to infer private information about the user. To address
the privacy concerns of LBS users, a large number of security approaches have been proposed based
on the concept of k-anonymity. The central idea in location k-anonymity is to find a set of k-1 users
confined in a given geographical area of the actual user, such that the location of these k users are
indistinguishable from one another, thus protecting the identity of the user. Although a number
of performance parameters like success rate, amount of privacy achieved are used to measure the
performance of the k-anonymity approaches, they make the implicit, unrealistic assumption that
the k-1 users are readily available. As such these approaches ignore the turnaround time to process
a user request, which is crucial for a real-time application like LBS. In this work, we model the k-anonymity
approaches using queuing theory to compute the average sojourn time of users and queue length of
the system. To demonstrate that queuing theory can be used to model all k-anonymity approaches,
we consider graph-based k-anonymity approaches. The proposed analytical model is further validated
with experimental results.
