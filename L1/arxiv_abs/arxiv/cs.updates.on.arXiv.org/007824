Standard scan plane detection in fetal brain ultrasound (US) forms a crucial step in the assessment
of fetal development. In clinical settings, this is done by manually manoeuvring a 2D probe to the
desired scan plane. With the advent of 3D US, the entire fetal brain volume containing these standard
planes can be easily acquired. However, manual standard plane identification in 3D volume is labour-intensive
and requires expert knowledge of fetal anatomy. We propose a new Iterative Transformation Network
(ITN) for the automatic detection of standard planes in 3D volumes. ITN uses a convolutional neural
network to learn the relationship between a 2D plane image and the transformation parameters required
to move that plane towards the location/orientation of the standard plane in the 3D volume. During
inference, the current plane image is passed iteratively to the network until it converges to the
standard plane location. We explore the effect of using different transformation representations
as regression outputs of ITN. Under a multi-task learning framework, we introduce additional classification
probability outputs to the network to act as confidence measures for the regressed transformation
parameters in order to further improve the localisation accuracy. When evaluated on 72 US volumes
of fetal brain, our method achieves an error of 3.83mm/12.7 degrees and 3.80mm/12.6 degrees for
the transventricular and transcerebellar planes respectively and takes 0.46s per plane. Source
