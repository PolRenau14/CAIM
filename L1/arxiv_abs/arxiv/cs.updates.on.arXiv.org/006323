Several centrality measures have been formulated to quantify the notion of 'importance' of actors
in social networks. Current measures scrutinize either local or global connectivity of the nodes
and have been found to be inadequate for social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure,
which are inherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy. Positional
hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are intuitively crucial determinants of
his importance. The theory of social capital asserts that an actor's importance is derived from
his position in network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through intra-community
(bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel centrality
measure SC (Social Centrality) for actors in social networks. Our measure accounts for - i) an individual's
propensity to socialize, and ii) his connections within and outside the community. These two factors
are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative analysis of SC measure
with classical and recent centrality measures using large public networks shows that it consistently
produces a more realistic ranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth
for each tested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and mapping with
known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness in diverse social networks.
Scalability evaluation of SC measure justifies its efficacy for real-world large networks.
