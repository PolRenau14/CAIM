In fog-aided cellular systems, content delivery latency can be minimized by jointly optimizing
edge caching and transmission strategies. In order to account for the cache capacity limitations
at the Edge Nodes (ENs), transmission generally involves both fronthaul transfer from a cloud processor
with access to the content library to the ENs, as well as wireless delivery from the ENs to the users.
In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint by making
the following practically relevant assumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded
fractional caching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of contents; and
4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on the wireless channel. Assuming offline
proactive caching and focusing on a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) latency metric, the optimal
information-theoretic performance is investigated under both serial and pipelined fronthaul-edge
transmission modes. The analysis characterizes the minimum high-SNR latency in terms of Normalized
Delivery Time (NDT) for worst-case users' demands. The characterization is exact for a subset of
system parameters, and is generally optimal within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 for the serial
case and of 2 for the pipelined case. The results bring insights into the optimal interplay between
edge and cloud processing in fog-aided wireless networks as a function of system resources, including
the number of antennas at the ENs, the ENs' cache capacity and the fronthaul capacity.
