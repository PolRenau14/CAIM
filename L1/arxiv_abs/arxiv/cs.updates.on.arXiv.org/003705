Online Reputation Monitoring (ORM) is concerned with the use of computational tools to measure
the reputation of entities online, such as politicians or companies. In practice, current ORM methods
are constrained to the generation of data analytics reports, which aggregate statistics of popularity
and sentiment on social media. We argue that this format is too restrictive as end users often like
to have the flexibility to search for entity-centric information that is not available in predefined
charts. As such, we propose the inclusion of entity retrieval capabilities as a first step towards
the extension of current ORM capabilities. However, an entity's reputation is also influenced
by the entity's relationships with other entities. Therefore, we address the problem of Entity-Relationship
(E-R) retrieval in which the goal is to search for multiple connected entities. This is a challenging
problem which traditional entity search systems cannot cope with. Besides E-R retrieval we also
believe ORM would benefit of text-based entity-centric prediction capabilities, such as predicting
entity popularity on social media based on news events or the outcome of political surveys. However,
none of these tasks can provide useful results if there is no effective entity disambiguation and
sentiment analysis tailored to the context of ORM. Consequently, this thesis address two computational
problems in Online Reputation Monitoring: Entity Retrieval and Text Mining. We researched and
developed methods to extract, retrieve and predict entity-centric information spread across
the Web.
