The multiterminal secret key agreement problem by public discussion is formulated with an additional
source compression step where, prior to the public discussion phase, users independently compress
their private sources to filter out strongly correlated components for generating a common secret
key. The objective is to maximize the achievable key rate as a function of the joint entropy of the
compressed sources. Since the maximum achievable key rate captures the total amount of information
mutual to the compressed sources, an optimal compression scheme essentially maximizes the multivariate
mutual information per bit of randomness of the private sources, and can therefore be viewed more
generally as a dimension reduction technique. Single-letter lower and upper bounds on the maximum
achievable key rate are derived for the general source model, and an explicit polynomial-time computable
formula is obtained for the pairwise independent network model. In particular, the converse results
and the upper bounds are obtained from those of the related secret key agreement problem with rate-limited
discussion. A precise duality is shown for the two-user case with one-way discussion, and such duality
is extended to obtain the desired converse results in the multi-user case. In addition to posing
new challenges in information processing and dimension reduction, the compressed secret key agreement
problem helps shed new light on resolving the difficult problem of secret key agreement with rate-limited
discussion, by offering a more structured achieving scheme and some simpler conjectures to prove.
