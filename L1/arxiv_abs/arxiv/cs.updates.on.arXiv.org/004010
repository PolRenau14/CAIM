Social networks often provide only a binary perspective on social ties: two individuals are either
connected or not. While sometimes external information can be used to infer the \emph{strength}
of social ties, access to such information may be restricted or impractical. Sintos and Tsaparas
(KDD 2014) first suggested to infer the strength of social ties from the topology of the network alone,
by leveraging the \emph{Strong Triadic Closure (STC)} property. %---postulated to hold in social
networks~\cite{sim:08}. The STC property states that if person $A$ has strong social ties with
persons $B$ and $C$, $B$ and $C$ must be connected to each other as well (whether with a weak or strong
tie). Sintos and Tsaparas exploited this to formulate the inference of the strength of social ties
as NP-hard optimization problem, and proposed two approximation algorithms. We refine and improve
upon this landmark paper, by developing a sequence of linear relaxations of this problem that can
be solved exactly in polynomial time. Usefully, these relaxations infer more fine-grained levels
of tie strength (beyond strong and weak), which also allows to avoid making arbitrary strong/weak
strength assignments when the network topology provides inconclusive evidence. One of the relaxations
simultaneously infers the presence of a limited number of STC violations. An extensive theoretical
analysis leads to two efficient algorithmic approaches. Finally, our experimental results elucidate
the strengths of the proposed approach, and sheds new light on the validity of the STC property in
practice.
