Collaborative spectrum sensing has been recognized as a promising approach to improve the sensing
performance via exploiting the spatial diversity of the secondary users. In this study, a new selfishness
issue is identified, that selfish users sense no spectrum in collaborative sensing. For easier
presentation, it's denoted as entropy selfishness. This selfish behavior is difficult to distinguish,
making existing detection based incentive schemes fail to work. To thwart entropy selfishness
in distributed collaborative sensing, we propose YouSense, a One-Time Pad (OTP) based incentive
design that could naturally isolate entropy selfish users from the honest users without selfish
node detection. The basic idea of YouSense is to construct a trapdoor one-time pad for each sensing
report by combining the original report and a random key. Such a one-time pad based encryption could
prevent entropy selfish users from accessing the original sensing report while enabling the honest
users to recover the report. Different from traditional cryptography based OTP which requires
the key delivery, YouSense allows an honest user to recover the pad (or key) by exploiting a unique
characteristic of collaborative sensing that different secondary users share some common observations
on the same radio spectrum. We further extend YouSense to improve the recovery successful rate by
reducing the cardinality of set of the possible pads. By extensive USRP based experiments, we show
that YouSense can successfully thwart entropy selfishness with low system overhead.
