Existing model-based processes for embedded real-time systems support the analysis of various
non-functional properties, most notably schedulability, through model checking, simulation
or other means. The analysis results are then used for modifying the system's design, so that the
expected properties are satisfied. A rigorous model-based design flow differs in that it aims at
a system implementation derived from high-level models by applying a sequence of semantics-preserving
transformations. Properties established at any design step are preserved throughout the subsequent
steps including the executable implementation. We introduce such a design flow using a process
network model of computation for application design at a high level, which combines streaming and
reactive control processing with task parallelism. The schedulability of the so-called FPPNs
(Fixed Priority Process Networks) is well-studied and various solutions have been presented.
This article focuses on the design flow's steps for deriving executable implementations on the
BIP (Behavior - Interaction - Priority) runtime environment. FPPNs are designed using the TASTE
toolset, a convenient architecture description interface. In this way, the developers do not program
explicitly low-level real-time OS services and the schedulability properties are guaranteed
throughout the design steps by construction. The approach has been validated on the design of a real
spacecraft on-board application that has been scheduled for execution on an industrial multicore
platform.
