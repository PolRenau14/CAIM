Spectral Doppler ultrasound imaging allows visualizing blood flow by estimating its velocity
distribution over time. Duplex ultrasound is a modality in which an ultrasound system is used for
displaying simultaneously both B-mode images and spectral Doppler data. In B-mode imaging short
wide-band pulses are used to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in the images. In contrast,
for Doppler imaging, narrow-band pulses are preferred in order to attain increased spectral resolution.
Thus, the acquisition time must be shared between the two sequences. In this work, we propose a non-uniform
slow-time transmission scheme for spectral Doppler, based on nested arrays, which reduces the
number of pulses needed for accurate spectrum recovery. We derive the minimal number of Doppler
emissions needed, using this approach, for perfect reconstruction of the blood spectrum in a noise-free
environment. Next, we provide two spectrum recovery techniques which achieve this minimal number.
The first method performs efficient recovery based on the fast Fourier transform. The second allows
for continuous recovery of the Doppler frequencies, thus avoiding off-grid error leakage, at the
expense of increased complexity. The performance of the techniques is evaluated using realistic
Field II simulations as well as in vivo measurements, producing accurate spectrograms of the blood
velocities using a significant reduced number of transmissions. The time gained, where no Doppler
pulses are sent, can be used to enable the display of both blood velocities and high quality B-mode
images at a high frame rate.
