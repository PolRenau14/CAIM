The pictorial jigsaw (PJ) puzzle is a well-known leisure game for humans. Usually, a PJ puzzle game
is played by one or several human players face-to-face in the physical space. In this paper, we focus
on how to solve PJ puzzles in the cyberspace by a group of physically distributed human players. We
propose an approach to solving PJ puzzle by stigmergy-inspired Internet-based human collective
intelligence. The core of the approach is a continuously executing loop, named the EIF loop, which
consists of three activities: exploration, integration, and feedback. In exploration, each player
tries to solve the PJ puzzle alone, without direct interactions with other players. At any time,
the result of a player's exploration is a partial solution to the PJ puzzle, and a set of rejected neighboring
relation between pieces. The results of all players' exploration are integrated in real time through
integration, with the output of a continuously updated collective opinion graph (COG). And through
feedback, each player is provided with personalized feedback information based on the current
COG and the player's exploration result, in order to accelerate his/her puzzle-solving process.
Exploratory experiments show that: (1) supported by this approach, the time to solve PJ puzzle is
nearly linear to the reciprocal of the number of players, and shows better scalability to puzzle
size than that of face-to-face collaboration for 10-player groups; (2) for groups with 2 to 10 players,
the puzzle-solving time decreases 31.36%-64.57% on average, compared with the best single players
in the experiments.
