Earthquake signal detection is at the core of observational seismology. A good detection algorithm
should be sensitive to small and weak events with a variety of waveform shapes, robust to background
noise and non-earthquake signals, and efficient for processing large data volumes. Here, we introduce
the Cnn-Rnn Earthquake Detector (CRED), a detector based on deep neural networks. The network uses
a combination of convolutional layers and bi-directional long-short-term memory units in a residual
structure. It learns the time-frequency characteristics of the dominant phases in an earthquake
signal from three component data recorded on a single station. We train the network using 500,000
seismograms (250k associated with tectonic earthquakes and 250k identified as noise) recorded
in Northern California and tested it with an F-score of 99.95. The robustness of the trained model
with respect to the noise level and non-earthquake signals is shown by applying it to a set of semi-synthetic
signals. The model is applied to one month of continuous data recorded at Central Arkansas to demonstrate
its efficiency, generalization, and sensitivity. Our model is able to detect more than 700 microearthquakes
as small as -1.3 ML induced during hydraulic fracturing far away than the training region. The performance
of the model is compared with STA/LTA, template matching, and FAST algorithms. Our results indicate
an efficient and reliable performance of CRED. This framework holds great promise in lowering the
detection threshold while minimizing false positive detection rates.
