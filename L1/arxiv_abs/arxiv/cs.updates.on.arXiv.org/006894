The current landscape of scientific research is widely based on modeling and simulation, typically
with complexity in the simulation's flow of execution and parameterization properties. Execution
flows are not necessarily straightforward since they may need multiple processing tasks and iterations.
Furthermore, parameter and performance studies are common approaches used to characterize a simulation,
often requiring traversal of a large parameter space. High-performance computers offer practical
resources at the expense of users handling the setup, submission, and management of jobs. This work
presents the design of PaPaS, a portable, lightweight, and generic workflow framework for conducting
parallel parameter and performance studies. Workflows are defined using parameter files based
on keyword-value pairs syntax, thus removing from the user the overhead of creating complex scripts
to manage the workflow. A parameter set consists of any combination of environment variables, files,
partial file contents, and command line arguments. PaPaS is being developed in Python 3 with support
for distributed parallelization using SSH, batch systems, and C++ MPI. The PaPaS framework will
run as user processes, and can be used in single/multi-node and multi-tenant computing systems.
An example simulation using the BehaviorSpace tool from NetLogo and a matrix multiply using OpenMP
are presented as parameter and performance studies, respectively. The results demonstrate that
the PaPaS framework offers a simple method for defining and managing parameter studies, while increasing
resource utilization.
