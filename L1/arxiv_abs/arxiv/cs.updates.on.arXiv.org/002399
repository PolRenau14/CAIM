Java platform and third-party libraries provide various security features to facilitate secure
coding. However, misusing these features can cost tremendous time and effort of developers or cause
security vulnerabilities in software. Prior research was focused on the misuse of cryptography
and SSL APIs, but did not explore the key fundamental research question: what are the biggest challenges
and vulnerabilities in secure coding practices? In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive empirical
study on StackOverflow posts to understand developers' concerns on Java secure coding, their programming
obstacles, and potential vulnerabilities in their code. We observed that developers have shifted
their effort to the usage of authentication and authorization features provided by Spring security--a
third-party framework designed to secure enterprise applications. Multiple programming challenges
are related to APIs or libraries, including the complicated cross-language data handling of cryptography
APIs, and the complex Java-based or XML-based approaches to configure Spring security. More interestingly,
we identified security vulnerabilities in the suggested code of accepted answers. The vulnerabilities
included using insecure hash functions such as MD5, breaking SSL/TLS security through bypassing
certificate validation, and insecurely disabling the default protection against Cross Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Our findings reveal the insufficiency of secure coding assistance and
education, and the gap between security theory and coding practices.
