With the current exponential growth in traffic and service demands, device-to-device (D2D) cooperation
is identified as a major mechanism to enable 5G networks to effectively and efficiently augment
network resources. The effectiveness of D2D cooperation depends on a wide range of decision making
processes that include cluster formation, resource allocation, in addition to connection and
mobility management. Irrespective of the D2D cooperation scenario whether in sensor, ad hoc, or
cellular networks, the literature normally assumes that devices selected as relays or data sources
are reliable; this means that they will maintain the connection till the communication session
ends. Yet, this assumption is challenged in practice since devices' batteries can be depleted (e.g.,
sensors in an IoT network) and devices can move leading to connection termination (e.g., mobile
users in a WiFi network or cars in a vehicular ad hoc network). To this end, we address the problem of
reliable D2D cooperation in wireless networks by proposing a novel approach that is proactive by
utilizing reliability metrics in the decision making process, and scalable by having low implementation
complexity suitable for dense networks. These differentiating factors are shown to enhance the
overall network reliability compared to standard techniques and to facilitate dynamic operation
which is essential for practical implementation. Performance is evaluated using extensive simulations
in addition to test bed experimental demonstration in order to quantify gains and extract insights
on a range of existing design tradeoffs.
