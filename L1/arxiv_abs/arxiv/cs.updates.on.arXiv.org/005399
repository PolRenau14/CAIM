We study the problem of finding a minimum weight connected subgraph spanning at least $k$ vertices
on planar, node-weighted graphs. We give a $(4+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for this problem.
We achieve this by utilizing the recent LMP primal-dual $3$-approximation for the node-weighted
prize-collecting Steiner tree problem by Byrka et al (SWAT'16) and adopting an approach by Chudak
et al. (Math.\ Prog.\ '04) regarding Lagrangian relaxation for the edge-weighted variant. In particular,
we improve the procedure of picking additional vertices (tree merging procedure) given by Sadeghian
(2013) by taking a constant number of recursive steps and utilizing the limited guessing procedure
of Arora and Karakostas (Math.\ Prog.\ '06). More generally, our approach readily gives a $(\nicefrac{4}{3}\cdot
r+\eps)$-approximation on any graph class where the algorithm of Byrka et al.\ for the prize-collecting
version gives an $r$-approximation. We argue that this can be interpreted as a generalization of
an analogous result by K\"onemann et al. (Algorithmica~'11) for partial cover problems. Together
with a lower bound construction by Mestre (STACS'08) for partial cover this implies that our bound
is essentially best possible among algorithms that utilize an LMP algorithm for the Lagrangian
relaxation as a black box. In addition to that, we argue by a more involved lower bound construction
that even using the LMP algorithm by Byrka et al.\ in a \emph{non-black-box} fashion could not beat
the factor $\nicefrac{4}{3}\cdot r$ when the tree merging step relies only on the solutions output
by the LMP algorithm.
