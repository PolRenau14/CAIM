This paper is concerned with the problem of exact MAP inference in general higher-order graphical
models by means of a traditional linear programming relaxation approach. In fact, the proof that
we have developed in this paper is a rather simple algebraic proof being made straightforward, above
all, by the introduction of two novel algebraic tools. Indeed, on the one hand, we introduce the notion
of delta-distribution which merely stands for the difference of two arbitrary probability distributions,
and which mainly serves to alleviate the sign constraint inherent to a traditional probability
distribution. On the other hand, we develop an approximation framework of general discrete functions
by means of an orthogonal projection expressing in terms of linear combinations of function margins
with respect to a given collection of point subsets, though, we rather exploit the latter approach
for the purpose of modeling locally consistent sets of discrete functions from a global perspective.
After that, as a first step, we develop from scratch the expectation optimization framework which
is nothing else than a reformulation, on stochastic grounds, of the convex-hull approach, as a second
step, we develop the traditional LP relaxation of such an expectation optimization approach, and
we show that it enables to solve the MAP inference problem in graphical models under rather general
assumptions. Last but not least, we describe an algorithm which allows to compute an exact MAP solution
from a perhaps fractional optimal (probability) solution of the proposed LP relaxation.
