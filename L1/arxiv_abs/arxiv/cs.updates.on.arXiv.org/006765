This work is a continuation of efforts to define and understand competitive analysis of algorithms
in a distributed shared memory setting, which is surprisingly different from the classical online
setting. In fact, in a distributed shared memory setting, we find a counter-example to the theorem
concerning classical randomized online algorithms which shows that, if there is a $c$-competitive
randomized algorithm against an adaptive offline adversary, then there is a $c$-competitive deterministic
algorithm [Ben-David, Borodin, Karp, Tardos, Wigderson, 1994]. In a distributed setting, there
is additional lack of knowledge concerning what the other processes have done. There is also additional
power for the adversary, having control of the scheduler which decides when each process is allowed
to take steps. We consider the list accessing problem, which is a benchmark problem for sequential
online algorithms. In the distributed version of this problem, each process has its own finite sequence
of requests to a shared list. The scheduler arises as a major issue in its competitive analysis. We
introduce two different adversaries, which differ in how they are allowed to schedule processes,
and use them to perform competitive analysis of distributed list accessing. We prove tight upper
and lower bounds on combinatorial properties of merges of the request sequences, which we use in
the analysis. Our analysis shows that the effects of the adversarial scheduler can be quite significant,
dominating the usual quality loss due to lack of information about the future.
