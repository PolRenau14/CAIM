By combining several interesting applications of random sampling in geometric algorithms like
point location, linear programming, segment intersections, binary space partitioning, Clarkson
and Shor \cite{CS89} developed a general framework of randomized incremental construction (RIC
). The basic idea is to add objects in a random order and show that this approach yields efficient/optimal
bounds on {\bf expected} running time. Even quicksort can be viewed as a special case of this paradigm.
However, unlike quicksort, for most of these problems, attempts to obtain sharper tail estimates
on the running time had proved inconclusive. Barring some results by \cite{MSW93,CMS92,Seidel91a},
the general question remains unresolved. In this paper we present some general techniques to obtain
tail estimates for RIC and and provide applications to some fundamental problems like Delaunay
triangulations and construction of Visibility maps of intersecting line segments. The main result
of the paper centers around a new and careful application of Freedman's \cite{Fre75} inequality
for Martingale concentration that overcomes the bottleneck of the better known Azuma-Hoeffding
inequality. Further, we show instances where an RIC based algorithm may not have inverse polynomial
tail estimates. In particular, we show that the RIC time bounds for trapezoidal map can encounter
a running time of $\Omega (n\log n\log\log n )$ with probability exceeding $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$.
This rules out inverse polynomial concentration bounds around the expected running time.
