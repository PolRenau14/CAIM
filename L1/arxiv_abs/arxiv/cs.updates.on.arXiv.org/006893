Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide.
The most used imaging technique to help in its diagnosis and follow-up is magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images are usually acquired in the context
of MS because lesions often appear hyperintense in this particular image weight, making it easier
for physicians to identify them. Though lesions have a bright intensity profile, it may overlap
with white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissues, posing difficulties to be accurately segmented.
In this sense, we propose a lesion enhancement technique to dim down WM and GM regions and highlight
hyperintensities, making them much more distinguishable than other tissues. We applied our technique
to the ISBI 2015 MS Lesion Segmentation Challenge and took the average gray level intensity of MS
lesions, WM and GM on FLAIR and enhanced images. The lesion intensity profile in FLAIR was on average
25% and 19% brighter than white matter and gray matter, respectively; comparatively, the same profile
in our enhanced images was on average 444% and 264% brighter. Such results mean a significant improvement
on the intensity distinction among these three clusters, which may come as aid both for experts and
automated techniques. Moreover, a byproduct of our proposal is that the enhancement can be used
to automatically estimate a mask encompassing WM and MS lesions, which may be useful for brain tissue
volume assessment and improve MS lesion segmentation accuracy in future works.
