Modern object detectors usually suffer from low accuracy issues, as foregrounds always drown in
tons of backgrounds and become hard examples during training. Compared with those proposal-based
ones, real-time detectors are in far more serious trouble since they renounce the use of region-proposing
stage which is used to filter a majority of backgrounds for achieving real-time rates. Though foregrounds
as hard examples are in urgent need of being mined from tons of backgrounds, a considerable number
of state-of-the-art real-time detectors, like YOLO series, have yet to profit from existing hard
example mining methods, as using these methods need detectors fit series of prerequisites. In this
paper, we propose a general hard example mining method named Loss Rank Mining (LRM) to fill the gap.
LRM is a general method for real-time detectors, as it utilizes the final feature map which exists
in all real-time detectors to mine hard examples. By using LRM, some elements representing easy
examples in final feature map are filtered and detectors are forced to concentrate on hard examples
during training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. With our method,
the improvements of YOLOv2 detector on auto-driving related dataset KITTI and more general dataset
PASCAL VOC are over 5% and 2% mAP, respectively. In addition, LRM is the first hard example mining
strategy which could fit YOLOv2 perfectly and make it better applied in series of real scenarios
where both real-time rates and accurate detection are strongly demanded.
