Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) pushes computing functionalities away from the centralized cloud
to the network edge, thereby meeting the latency requirements of many emerging mobile applications
and saving backhaul network bandwidth. Although many existing works have studied computation
offloading policies, service caching is an equally, if not more important, design topic of MEC,
yet receives much less attention. Service caching refers to caching application services and their
related databases/libraries in the edge server (e.g. MEC-enabled BS), thereby enabling corresponding
computation tasks to be executed. Because only a small number of application services can be cached
in resource-limited edge server at the same time, which services to cache has to be judiciously decided
to maximize the edge computing performance. In this paper, we investigate the extremely compelling
but much less studied problem of dynamic service caching in MEC-enabled dense cellular networks.
We propose an efficient online algorithm, called OREO, which jointly optimizes dynamic service
caching and task offloading to address a number of key challenges in MEC systems, including service
heterogeneity, unknown system dynamics, spatial demand coupling and decentralized coordination.
Our algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization and Gibbs sampling, works online without
requiring future information, and achieves provable close-to-optimal performance. Simulation
results show that our algorithm can effectively reduce computation latency for end users while
keeping energy consumption low.
