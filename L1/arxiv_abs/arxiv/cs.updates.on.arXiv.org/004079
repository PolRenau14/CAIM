Variational systems allow effective building of many custom variants by using features (configuration
options) to mark the variable functionality. In many of the applications, their quality assurance
and formal verification are of paramount importance. Family-based model checking allows simultaneous
verification of all variants of a variational system in a single run by exploiting the commonalities
between the variants. Yet, its computational cost still greatly depends on the number of variants
(often huge). In this work, we show how to achieve efficient family-based model checking of CTL*
temporal properties using variability abstractions and off-the-shelf (single-system) tools.
We use variability abstractions for deriving abstract family-based model checking, where the
variability model of a variational system is replaced with an abstract (smaller) version of it,
called modal featured transition system, which preserves the satisfaction of both universal and
existential temporal properties, as expressible in CTL*. Modal featured transition systems contain
two kinds of transitions, termed may and must transitions, which are defined by the conservative
(over-approximating) abstractions and their dual (under-approximating) abstractions, respectively.
The variability abstractions can be combined with different partitionings of the set of variants
to infer suitable divide-and-conquer verification plans for the variational system. We illustrate
the practicality of this approach for several variational systems.
