This paper gives a novel approach to analyze SAT problem more deeply. First, I define new elements
of Boolean formula such as dominant variable, decision chain, and chain coupler. Through the analysis
of the SAT problem using the elements, I prove that we can construct a k-SAT (k>2) instance where the
coefficients of cutting planes take exponentially large values in the input size. This exponential
property is caused by the number system formed from the calculation of coefficients. In addition,
I show that 2-SAT does not form the number system and Horn-SAT partially forms the number system according
to the feasible value of the dominant variable. Whether or not the coefficients of cutting planes
in cutting plane proof are polynomially bounded was open problem. Many researchers believed that
cutting plane proofs with large coefficients are highly non-intuitive20. However, we can construct
a k-SAT (k>2) instance in which cutting planes take exponentially large coefficients by the number
system. In addition, this exponential property is so strong that it gives definite answers for several
questions: why Horn-SAT has the intermediate property between 2-SAT and 3-SAT; why random-SAT
is so easy; and why k-SAT (k>2) cannot be solved with the linear programming technique. As we know,
2-SAT is NL-complete, Horn-SAT is P-complete, and k-SAT (k>2) is NP-complete. In terms of computational
complexity, this paper gives a clear mathematical property by which SAT problems in three different
classes are distinguished.
