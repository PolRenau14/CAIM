An archetypal problem discussed in computer science is the problem of searching for a given number
in a given set of numbers. Other than sequential search, the classic solution is to sort the list of
numbers and then apply binary search. The binary search problem has a complexity of O(logN) for a
list of N numbers while the sorting problem cannot be better than O(N) on any sequential computer
following the usual assumptions. Whenever the problem of deciding partial order can be done in O(1),
a variation of the problem on some bounded list of numbers is to apply binary search without resorting
to sort. The overall complexity of the problem is then O(log R) for some radius R. A logarithmic upper-bound
for finite encodings is shown. Also, the topology of orderings can provide efficient algorithms
for search problems in combinatorial spaces. The main characteristic of those spaces is that they
have typical exponential space complexities. The factorial case describes an order topology that
can be illustrated using the combinatorial polytope . When a known order topology can be combined
to a given formulation of a search problem, the resulting search problem has a polylogarithmic complexity.
This logarithmic complexity can then become useful in combinatorial search by providing a logarithmic
break-down. These algorithms can be termed as the class of search algorithms that do not require
read and are equivalent to the class of logarithmically recursive functions. Also, the notion of
order invariance is discussed.
