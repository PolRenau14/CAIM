Network coding (NC) is a novel coding technology that can be seen as a generalization of classic point-to-point
coding. As with classic coding, both information theoretical and algebraic views bring different
and complementary insights of NC benefits and corresponding tradeoffs. However, the multi-user
nature of NC and its inherent applicability across all layers of the protocol stack, call for novel
design approaches towards efficient practical implementation of this technology. In this paper,
we present a possible way forward to the design of NC as a virtual network functionality offered to
the communication service designer. Specifically, we propose the integration of NC and Network
Function Virtualization (NFV) architectural designs. The integration is realized as a toolbox
of NC design domains that the service designer can use for flow engineering. Our proposed design
framework combines network protocol-driven design and system modular-driven design approaches.
In particular, the adaptive choice of the network codes and its use for a specific service can then
be tailored and optimized depending on the ultimate service intent and underlying (virtualized)
system or network. We work out a complete use case where we design geo-network coding, an application
of NC for which coding rate is optimized using databases of geo-location information towards an
energy-efficient use of resources. Our numerical results highlight the benefits of both the proposed
NC design framework and the specific application.
