This technical note presents the design of a new area optimized asynchronous early output dual-bit
full adder (DBFA). An asynchronous ripple carry adder (RCA) is constructed based on the new asynchronous
DBFAs and existing asynchronous early output single-bit full adders (SBFAs). The asynchronous
DBFAs and SBFAs incorporate redundant logic and are encoded using the delay-insensitive dual-rail
code (i.e. homogeneous data encoding) and follow a 4-phase return-to-zero handshaking. Compared
to the previous asynchronous RCAs involving DBFAs and SBFAs, which are based on homogeneous or heterogeneous
delay-insensitive data encodings and which correspond to different timing models, the early output
asynchronous RCA incorporating the proposed DBFAs and/or SBFAs is found to result in reduced area
for the dual-operand addition operation and feature significantly less latency than the asynchronous
RCAs which consist of only SBFAs. The proposed asynchronous DBFA requires 28.6% less silicon than
the previously reported asynchronous DBFA. For a 32-bit asynchronous RCA, utilizing 2 stages of
SBFAs in the least significant positions and 15 stages of DBFAs in the more significant positions
leads to optimization in the latency. The new early output 32-bit asynchronous RCA containing DBFAs
and SBFAs reports the following optimizations in design metrics over its counterparts: i) 18.8%
reduction in area than a previously reported 32-bit early output asynchronous RCA which also has
15 stages of DBFAs and 2 stages of SBFAs, ii) 29.4% reduction in latency than a 32-bit early output
asynchronous RCA containing only SBFAs.
