Handwritten word recognition and spotting of low-resource scripts are difficult as sufficient
training data is not available and it is often expensive for collecting data of such scripts. This
paper presents a novel cross language platform for handwritten word recognition and spotting for
such low-resource scripts where training is performed with a sufficiently large dataset of an available
script (considered as source script) and testing is done on other scripts (considered as target
script). Training with one source script and testing with another script to have a reasonable result
is not easy in handwriting domain due to the complex nature of handwriting variability among scripts.
Also it is difficult in mapping between source and target characters when they appear in cursive
word images. The proposed Indic cross language framework exploits a large resource of dataset for
training and uses it for recognizing and spotting text of other target scripts where sufficient
amount of training data is not available. Since, Indic scripts are mostly written in 3 zones, namely,
upper, middle and lower, we employ zone-wise character (or component) mapping for efficient learning
purpose. The performance of our cross-language framework depends on the extent of similarity between
the source and target scripts. Hence, we devise an entropy based script similarity score using source
to target character mapping that will provide a feasibility of cross language transcription. We
have tested our approach in three Indic scripts, namely, Bangla, Devanagari and Gurumukhi, and
the corresponding results are reported.
