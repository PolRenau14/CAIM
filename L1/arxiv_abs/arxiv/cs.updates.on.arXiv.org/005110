Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) is an important tool within computational real algebraic
geometry, capable of solving many problems to do with polynomial systems over the reals, but known
to have worst-case computational complexity doubly exponential in the number of variables. It
has long been studied by the Symbolic Computation community and is implemented in a variety of computer
algebra systems, however, it has also found recent interest in the Satisfiability Checking community
for use with SMT-solvers. The SCSC Project seeks to build bridges between these communities. The
present report describes progress made during a Research Internship in Summer 2017 funded by the
EU H2020 SCSC CSA. We describe a proof of concept implementation of an Incremental CAD algorithm
in Maple, where CADs are built and refined incrementally by polynomial constraint, in contrast
to the usual approach of a single computation from a single input. This advance would make CAD of use
to SMT-solvers who search for solutions by constantly reformulating logical formula and querying
solvers like CAD for whether a logical solution is admissible. We describe experiments for the proof
of concept, which clearly display the computational advantages when compared to iterated re-computation.
In addition, the project implemented this work under the recently verified Lazard projection scheme
(with corresponding Lazard evaluation). That is the minimal complete CAD method in theory, and
this is the first documented implementation.
