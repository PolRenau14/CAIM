The paradigm of shared spectrum allows secondary devices to opportunistically access spectrum
bands underutilized by primary owners. Recently, the FCC has targeted the sharing of the 3.5 GHz
(3550-3700 MHz) federal spectrum with commercial systems such as small cells. The rules require
a Spectrum Access System (SAS) to accommodate three service tiers: 1) Incumbent Access, 2) Priority
Access (PA), and 3) Generalized Authorized Access (GAA). In this work, we study the SAS-assisted
dynamic channel assignment (CA) for PA and GAA tiers.We introduce the node-channel-pair conflict
graph to capture pairwise interference, channel and geographic contiguity constraints, spatially
varying channel availability, and coexistence awareness. The proposed conflict graph allows
us to formulate PA CA and GAA CA with binary conflicts as max-cardinality and max-reward CA, respectively.
Approximate solutions can be found by a heuristic-based algorithm that search for the maximum weighted
independent set. We further formulate GAA CA with non-binary conflicts as max-utility CA. We show
that the utility function is submodular, and the problem is an instance of matroid-constrained
submodular maximization. A polynomial-time algorithm based on local search is proposed that provides
a provable performance guarantee. Extensive simulations using a real-world Wi-Fi hotspot location
dataset are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms. Our results have demonstrated the advantages
of the proposed graph representation and improved performance of the proposed algorithms over
the baseline algorithms.
