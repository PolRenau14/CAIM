We propose an approach based on neural networks and the AC power flow equations to identify single-
and double- line outages in a power grid using the information from phasor measurement unit sensors
(PMUs). Rather than inferring the outage from the sensor data by inverting the physical model, our
approach uses the AC model to simulate sensor responses to all outages of interest under multiple
demand and seasonal conditions, and uses the resulting data to train a neural network classifier
to recognize and discriminate between different outage events directly from sensor data. After
training, real-time deployment of the classifier requires just a few matrix-vector products and
simple vector operations. These operations can be executed much more rapidly than inversion of
a model based on AC power flow, which consists of nonlinear equations and possibly integer / binary
variables representing line outages, as well as the variables representing voltages and power
flows. We are motivated to use neural network by its successful application to such areas as computer
vision and natural language processing. Neural networks automatically find nonlinear transformations
of the raw data that highlight useful features that make the classification task easier. We further
consider the problem of classifying outages from sensors placed at only a subset of the buses, describing
a principled way to choose sensor locations and showing that highly accurate classification can
be achieved from a restricted set of measurements.
