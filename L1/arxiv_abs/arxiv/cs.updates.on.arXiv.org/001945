In the minimum planarization problem, given some $n$-vertex graph, the goal is to find a set of vertices
of minimum cardinality whose removal leaves a planar graph. This is a fundamental problem in topological
graph theory. We present a $\log^{O(1)} n$-approximation algorithm for this problem on general
graphs with running time $n^{O(\log n/\log\log n)}$. We also obtain a $O(n^\varepsilon)$-approximation
with running time $n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon > 0$.
Prior to our work, no non-trivial algorithm was known for this problem on general graphs, and the
best known result even on graphs of bounded degree was a $n^{\Omega(1)}$-approximation [Chekuri
and Sidiropoulos 2013]. As an immediate corollary, we also obtain improved approximation algorithms
for the crossing number problem on graphs of bounded degree. Specifically, we obtain $O(n^{1/2+\varepsilon})$-approximation
and $n^{1/2} \log^{O(1)} n$-approximation algorithms in time $n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ and $n^{O(\log
n/\log\log n)}$ respectively. The previously best-known result was a polynomial-time $n^{9/10}\log^{O(1)}
n$-approximation algorithm [Chuzhoy 2011]. Our algorithm introduces several new tools including
an efficient grid-minor construction for apex graphs, and a new method for computing irrelevant
vertices. Analogues of these tools were previously available only for exact algorithms. Our work
gives efficient implementations of these ideas in the setting of approximation algorithms, which
could be of independent interest.
