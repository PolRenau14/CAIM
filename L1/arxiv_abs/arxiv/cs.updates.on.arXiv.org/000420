The need for optical parallelization is driven by the imminent optical capacity crunch, where the
spectral efficiency required in the coming decades will be beyond the Shannon limit. To this end,
the emerging high-speed Ethernet services at 100 Gbps, have already standardized options to utilize
parallel optics to parallelize interfaces referred to as Multi-lane Distribution (MLD). OFDM-based
optical network is a promising transmission option towards the goal of Ethernet parallelization.
It can allocate optical resource tailored for a variety of bandwidth requirements and that in a fundamentally
parallel fashion with each sub-carrier utilizing a frequency slot at a lower rate than if serial
transmission was used. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel transmission framework designed
for elastic (OFDM-based) optical networks to support high-speed Ethernet services, in-line with
IEEE and ITU-T standards. We formulate an ILP optimization model based on integer linear programming,
with consideration of various constraints, including spectrum fragmentation, differential
delay and guard-band constraints. We also propose a heuristic algorithm which can be applied when
the optimization model becomes intractable. The numerical results show the effectiveness and
high suitability of elastic optical networks to support parallel transmission in high-speed Ethernet.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the parallel transmission
in elastic optical networks to support standardized high-speed Ethernet.
