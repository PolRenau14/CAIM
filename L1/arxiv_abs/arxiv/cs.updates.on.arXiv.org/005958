Efficient large-scale annotation of genomic intervals is essential for personal genome interpretation
in the realm of precision medicine. There are 13 possible relations between two intervals according
to Allen's interval algebra. Conventional interval trees are routinely used to identify the genomic
intervals satisfying a coarse relation with a query interval, but cannot support efficient query
for more refined relations such as all Allen's relations. We design and implement a novel approach
to address this unmet need. Through rewriting Allen's interval relations, we transform an interval
query to a range query, then adapt and utilize the range trees for querying. We implement two types
of range trees: a basic 2-dimensional range tree (2D-RT) and an augmented range tree with fractional
cascading (RTFC) and compare them with the conventional interval tree (IT). Theoretical analysis
shows that RTFC can achieve the best time complexity for interval queries regarding all Allen's
relations among the three trees. We also perform comparative experiments on the efficiency of RTFC,
2D-RT and IT in querying noncoding element annotations in a large collection of personal genomes.
Our experimental results show that 2D-RT is more efficient than IT for interval queries regarding
most of Allen's relations, RTFC is even more efficient than 2D-RT. The results demonstrate that
RTFC is an efficient data structure for querying large-scale datasets regarding Allen's relations
between genomic intervals, such as those required by interpreting genome-wide variation in large
populations.
