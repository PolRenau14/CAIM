State-of-the-art methods for object detection use region proposal networks (RPN) to hypothesize
object location. These networks simultaneously predicts object bounding boxes and \emph{objectness}
scores at each location in the image. Unlike natural images for which RPN algorithms were originally
designed, most medical images are acquired following standard protocols, thus organs in the image
are typically at a similar location and possess similar geometrical characteristics (e.g. scale,
aspect-ratio, etc.). Therefore, medical image acquisition protocols hold critical localization
and geometric information that can be incorporated for faster and more accurate detection. This
paper presents a novel attention mechanism for the detection of organs by incorporating imaging
protocol information. Our novel selective attention approach (i) effectively shrinks the search
space inside the feature map, (ii) appends useful localization information to the hypothesized
proposal for the detection architecture to learn where to look for each organ, and (iii) modifies
the pyramid of regression references in the RPN by incorporating organ- and modality-specific
information, which results in additional time reduction. We evaluated the proposed framework
on a dataset of 768 chest X-ray images obtained from a diverse set of sources. Our results demonstrate
superior performance for the detection of the lung field compared to the state-of-the-art, both
in terms of detection accuracy, demonstrating an improvement of $>7\%$ in Dice score, and reduced
processing time by $27.53\%$ due to fewer hypotheses.
