This paper considers a generalized version of the coin weighing problem with a spring scale that
lies at the intersection of group testing and compressed sensing problems. Given a collection of
$n\geq 2$ coins of total weight $d$ (for a known integer $d$), where the weight of each coin is an unknown
integer in the range of $\{0,1,\dots,k\}$ (for a known integer $k\geq 1$), the problem is to determine
the weight of each coin by weighing subsets of coins in a spring scale. The goal is to minimize the average
number of weighings over all possible weight configurations. For $d=k=1$, an adaptive bisecting
weighing strategy is known to be optimal. However, even the case of $d=k=2$, which is the simplest
non-trivial case of the problem, is still open. For this case, we propose and analyze a simple and
effective adaptive weighing strategy. A numerical evaluation of the exact recursive formulas,
derived for the analysis of the proposed strategy, shows that this strategy requires about ${1.365\log_2
n -0.5}$ weighings on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial achievable
upper bound on the minimum expected required number of weighings for the case of $d=k=2$. As $n$ grows
unbounded, the proposed strategy, when compared to an optimal strategy within the commonly-used
class of nested strategies, requires about $31.75\%$ less number of weighings on average; and in
comparison with the information-theoretic lower bound, it requires at most about $8.16\%$ extra
number of weighings on average.
