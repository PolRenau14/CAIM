Bitcoin is the first implementation of what has become known as a 'public permissionless' blockchain.
Guaranteeing security and protocol conformity through its elegant combination of cryptographic
assurances and game theoretic economic incentives, it permits censorship resistant public read-write
access to its append-only blockchain database without the need for any mediating central authority.
Not until its advent has such a trusted, transparent, comprehensive and granular data set of digital
economic behaviours been available for public network analysis. In this article, by translating
the cumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity graph model,
we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked social and econometric benefits
of employing such a novel open data architecture. Specifically we show (a) how repeated patterns
of transaction behaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (b) how newly
mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations of wealth; (c) through
application of the na\"ive quantity theory of money that Bitcoin's disinflationary properties
can be revealed and measured; and (d) how the user community can develop coordinated defences against
repeated denial of service attacks on the network. All of the aforementioned being exemplary benefits
that would be lost with the closed data models of the 'private permissioned' distributed ledger
architectures that are dominating enterprise level development due to existing blockchain issues
of governance, scalability and confidentiality.
