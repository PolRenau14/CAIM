Using piezoelectric impedance/admittance sensing for structural health monitoring is promising,
owing to the simplicity in circuitry design as well as the high-frequency interrogation capability.
The actual identification of fault location and severity using impedance/admittance measurements,
nevertheless, remains to be an extremely challenging task. A first-principle based structural
model using finite element discretization requires high dimensionality to characterize the high-frequency
response. As such, direct inversion using the sensitivity matrix usually yields an under-determined
problem. Alternatively, the identification problem may be cast into an optimization framework
in which fault parameters are identified through repeated forward finite element analysis which
however is oftentimes computationally prohibitive. This paper presents an efficient data-assisted
optimization approach for fault identification without using finite element model iteratively.
We formulate a many-objective optimization problem to identify fault parameters, where response
surfaces of impedance measurements are constructed through Gaussian process-based calibration.
To balance between solution diversity and convergence, an -dominance enabled many-objective
simulated annealing algorithm is established. As multiple solutions are expected, a voting score
calculation procedure is developed to further identify those solutions that yield better implications
regarding structural health condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
by systematic numerical and experimental case studies.
