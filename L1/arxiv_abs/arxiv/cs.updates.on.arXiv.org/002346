Sometimes, we do not use a maximum likelihood estimator of a probability but it's a smoothed estimator
in order to cope with the zero frequency problem. This is often the case when we use the Naive Bayes
classifier. Laplace smoothing is a popular choice with the value of Laplace smoothing estimator
being the expected value of posterior distribution of the probability where we assume that the prior
is uniform distribution. In this paper, we investigate the confidence intervals of the estimator
of Laplace smoothing. We show that the likelihood function for this confidence interval is the same
as the likelihood of a maximum likelihood estimated value of a probability of Bernoulli trials.
Although the confidence interval of the maximum likelihood estimator of the Bernoulli trial probability
has been studied well, and although the approximate formulas for the confidence interval are well
known, we cannot use the interval of maximum likelihood estimator since the interval contains the
value 0, which is not suitable for the Naive Bayes classifier. We are also interested in the accuracy
of existing approximation methods since these approximation methods are frequently used but their
accuracy is not well discussed. Thus, we obtain the confidence interval by numerically integrating
the likelihood function. In this paper, we report the difference between the confidence interval
that we computed and the confidence interval by approximate formulas. Finally, we include a URL,
where all of the intervals that we computed are available.
