The problem of evacuating two robots from the disk in the face-to-face model was first introduced
in [Czyzowicz et al., DISC'14], and extensively studied (along with many variations) ever since
with respect to worst case analysis. We initiate the study of the same problem with respect to average
case analysis, which is also equivalent to designing randomized algorithms for the problem. First
we observe that algorithm $B_{2}$ of~[Czyzowicz et al., DISC'14] with worst case cost $WRS(B_{2}):=5.73906$
has average case cost $AVG(B_{2}):=5.1172$. Then we verify that none of the algorithms that induced
worst case cost improvements in subsequent publications has better average case cost, hence concluding
that our problem requires the invention of new algorithms. Then, we observe that a remarkable simple
algorithm, $B_{1}$, has very small average case cost $AVG(B_{1}):=1+\pi$, but very high worst
case cost $WRS(B_{1}):=1+2\pi$. Motivated by the above, we introduce constrained optimization
problem $_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, in which one is trying to minimize the average case cost of the evacuation
algorithm given that the worst case cost does not exceed $w$. The problem is of special interest with
respect to practical applications, since a common objective in search-and-rescue operations
is to minimize the average completion time, given that a certain worst case threshold is not exceeded,
e.g. for safety or limited energy reasons. Our main contribution is the design and analysis of families
of new evacuation parameterized algorithms $A(p)$ which can solve $_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, for every
$w \in [WRS(B_{1}),WRS(B_{2})]$.
