As the most prominent representative of 4G, Long term evolution (LTE) technology has become a focal
point for mobile network operators all over the world. However, although Iranian main operators
like MCI and Irancell have hugely invested on deployment of this technology, its diffusion has been
very slow with a penetration rate of 0.06 at the end of spring 2017. Nevertheless, if this rate doesn't
increase, it will yield some negative unintended consequences for telecom operators such as (I)
Failure to provide a large number of high quality services (II) Inability to compete with OTT technologies
(III) Loss of many revenue opportunities (IV) Prolongation of payback period and (V) The lack of
technological integrability with fifth generation networks (5G) and loss of many IOT opportunities.
Through discussing the literature of technology adoption and diffusion both generally and specifically,
identifying the major limitations of these studies and establishing a comprehensive factor set
based on four major groups of (I) mobile handset and operators-related factors (II) subscribers-related
biological factors, (III) subscribers-related perceptual factors and (IV) subscribers-related
contextual factors, a novel fuzzy DEMATEL model has been developed by which all ICT policy makers
can not only get a clear knowledge of factors influencing technology adoption but also know the critical
success factors (CSFs) influencing Iranians' mindsets towards LTE adoption. Therefore, they
can make effective and actionable policies to scale up LTE diffusion or other ICT-related technologies
throughout the society.
