Different techniques are used to model the relationship between temperatures, dew point and relative
humidity. Gene expression programming is capable of modelling complex realities with great accuracy,
allowing at the same time, the extraction of knowledge from the evolved models compared to other
learning algorithms. We aim to use Gene Expression Programming for modelling of dew point. Generally,
accuracy of the model is the only objective used by selection mechanism of GEP. This will evolve large
size models with low training error. To avoid this situation, use of multiple objectives, like accuracy
and size of the model are preferred by Genetic Programming practitioners. Solution to a multi-objective
problem is a set of solutions which satisfies the objectives given by decision maker. Multi objective
based GEP will be used to evolve simple models. Various algorithms widely used for multi objective
optimization, like NSGA II and SPEA 2, are tested on different test problems. The results obtained
thereafter gives idea that SPEA 2 is better than NSGA II based on the features like execution time,
number of solutions obtained and convergence rate. We selected SPEA 2 for dew point prediction.
The multi-objective base GEP produces accurate and simpler (smaller) solutions compared to solutions
produced by plain GEP for dew point predictions. Thus multi objective base GEP produces better solutions
by considering the dual objectives of fitness and size of the solution. These simple models can be
used to predict future values of dew point.
