Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence, web-based education
systems have became complementary and, in some cases, viable alternatives to traditional classroom
teaching. The popularity of these systems stems from their ability to make education available
to a large demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of the personalization
which becomes possible when web-based education is offered: they continue to be one-size-fits-all.
In this paper, we aim to provide a first systematic method for designing a personalized web-based
education system. Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided personalized
teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes already taken, methods of learning
preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type
and order of teaching materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should
be adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam, likes/dislikes
etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor, is able to address these challenges
by learning how to adapt the teaching methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material
to present to a student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the time
spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We illustrate the efficiency
of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor platform which is used for remedial training for a Digital
Signal Processing (DSP) course.
