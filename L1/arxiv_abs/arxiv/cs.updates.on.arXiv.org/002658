Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized environment where transactions
and data are not under the control of any third party organization. Any transaction ever completed
is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable and permanent way. Based on blockchain technology,
we propose a global higher education credit platform, named EduCTX. This platform is based on the
concept of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). It constitutes a globally
trusted, decentralized higher education credit and grading system that can offer a globally unified
viewpoint for students and higher education institutions (HEIs), as well as for other potential
stakeholders such as companies, institutions, and organizations. As a proof of concept, we present
a prototype implementation of the environment, based on the open-source Ark Blockchain Platform.
Based on a globally distributed peer-to-peer network, EduCTX will process, manage and control
ECTX tokens, which represent credits that students gain for completed courses such as ECTS. HEIs
are the peers of the blockchain network. The platform is a first step towards a more transparent and
technologically advanced form of higher education systems. The EduCTX platform represents the
basis of the EduCTX initiative which anticipates that various HEIs would join forces in order to
create a globally efficient, simplified and ubiquitous environment in order to avoid language
and administrative barriers. Therefore we invite and encourage HEIs to join the EduCTX initiative
and the EduCTX blockchain network.
