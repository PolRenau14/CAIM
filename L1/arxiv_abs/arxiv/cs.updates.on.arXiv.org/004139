We consider the multi-vehicle one-to-one pickup and delivery problem with split loads, a NP-hard
problem linked with a variety of applications for bulk product transportation, bike-sharing systems
and inventory re-balancing. This problem is notoriously difficult due to the interaction of two
challenging vehicle routing attributes, "pickups and deliveries" and "split deliveries". This
possibly leads to optimal solutions of a size that grows exponentially with the instance size, containing
multiple visits per customer pair, even in the same route. To solve this problem, we propose an iterated
local search metaheuristic as well as a branch-and-price algorithm. The core of the metaheuristic
consists of a new large neighborhood search, which reduces the problem of finding the best insertion
combination of a pickup and delivery pair into a route (with possible splits) to a resource-constrained
shortest path and knapsack problem. Similarly, the branch-and-price algorithm uses sophisticated
labeling techniques, route relaxations, pre-processing and branching rules for an efficient
resolution. Our computational experiments on classical single-vehicle instances demonstrate
the excellent performance of the metaheuristic, which produces new best known solutions for 92
out of 93 test instances, and outperforms all previous algorithms. Experimental results on new
multi-vehicle instances with distance constraints are also reported. The branch-and-price algorithm
produces optimal solutions for instances with up to 20 pickup-and-delivery pairs, and very accurate
solutions are found by the metaheuristic.
