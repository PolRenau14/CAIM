In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network systems, content (object) delivery between nodes is often required.
One way to study such a distributed system is by defining games, which involve selfish nodes that
make strategic choices on replicating content in their local limited memory (cache) or accessing
content from other nodes for a cost. These Selfish Replication games have been introduced in [8]
for nodes that do not have any capacity limits, leaving the capacitated problem, i.e. Capacitated
Selfish Replication (CSR) games, open. In this work, we first form the model of the CSR games, for
which we perform a Nash equilibria analysis. In particular, we focus on hierarchical networks,
given their extensive use to model communication costs of content delivery in P2P systems. We present
an exact polynomial-time algorithm for any hierarchical network, under two constraints on the
utility functions: 1) "Nearer is better", i.e. the closest the content is to the node the less its
access cost is, and 2) "Independence of irrelevant alternatives", i.e. aggregation of individual
node preferences. This generalization represents a vast class of utilities and more interestingly
allows each of the nodes to have simultaneously completely different functional forms of utility
functions. In this general framework, we present CSR games results on arbitrary networks and outline
the boundary between intractability and effective computability in terms of the network structure,
object preferences, and the total number of objects. Moreover, we prove that the problem of equilibria
existence becomes NP-hard for general CSR games.
