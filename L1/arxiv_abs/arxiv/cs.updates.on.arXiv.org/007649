Massive device connectivity is a crucial communication challenge for Internet of Things (IoT)
networks, which consist of a large number of devices with sporadic traffic. In each coherence block,
the serving base station needs to identify the active devices and estimate their channel state information
for effective communication. By exploiting the sparsity pattern of data transmission, we develop
a structured group sparsity estimation method to simultaneously detect the active devices and
estimate the corresponding channels. This method significantly reduces the signature sequence
length while supporting massive IoT access. To determine the optimal signature sequence length,
we study \emph{the phase transition behavior} of the group sparsity estimation problem. Specifically,
user activity can be successfully estimated with a high probability when the signature sequence
length exceeds a threshold; otherwise, it fails with a high probability. The location and width
of the phase transition region are characterized via the theory of conic integral geometry. We further
develop a smoothing method to solve the high-dimensional structured estimation problem with a
given limited time budget. This is achieved by sharply characterizing the convergence rate in terms
of the smoothing parameter, signature sequence length and estimation accuracy, yielding a trade-off
between the estimation accuracy and computational cost. Numerical results are provided to illustrate
the accuracy of our theoretical results and the benefits of smoothing techniques.
