Community detection is the task of identifying clusters or groups of nodes in a network where nodes
within the same group are more connected with each other than with nodes in different groups. It has
practical uses in identifying similar functions or roles of nodes in many biological, social and
computer networks. With the availability of very large networks in recent years, performance and
scalability of community detection algorithms become crucial, i.e. if time complexity of an algorithm
is high, it can not run on large networks. In this paper, we propose a new community detection algorithm,
which has a local approach and is able to run on large networks. It has a simple and effective method;
given a network, algorithm constructs a preference network of nodes where each node has a single
outgoing edge showing its preferred node to be in the same community with. In such a preference network,
each connected component is a community. Selection of the preferred node is performed using similarity
based metrics of nodes. We use two alternatives for this purpose which can be calculated in 1-neighborhood
of nodes, i.e. number of common neighbors of selector node and its neighbors and, the spread capability
of neighbors around the selector node which is calculated by the gossip algorithm of Lind et.al.
Our algorithm is tested on both computer generated LFR networks and real-life networks with ground-truth
community structure. It can identify communities accurately in a fast way. It is local, scalable
and suitable for distributed execution on large networks.
