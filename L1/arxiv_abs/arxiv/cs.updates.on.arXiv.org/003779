Testing whether a set $\mathbf{f}$ of polynomials has an algebraic dependence is a basic problem
with several applications. The polynomials are given as algebraic circuits. Algebraic independence
testing question is wide open over finite fields (Dvir, Gabizon, Wigderson, FOCS'07). The best
complexity known is NP$^{\#\rm P}$ (Mittmann, Saxena, Scheiblechner, Trans.AMS'14). In this
work we put the problem in AM $\cap$ coAM. In particular, dependence testing is unlikely to be NP-hard
and joins the league of problems of "intermediate" complexity, eg. graph isomorphism & integer
factoring. Our proof method is algebro-geometric-- estimating the size of the image/preimage
of the polynomial map $\mathbf{f}$ over the finite field. A gap in this size is utilized in the AM protocols.
Next, we study the open question of testing whether every annihilator of $\mathbf{f}$ has zero constant
term (Kayal, CCC'09). We give a geometric characterization using Zariski closure of the image of
$\mathbf{f}$; introducing a new problem called approximate polynomials satisfiability (APS).
We show that APS is NP-hard and, using projective algebraic-geometry ideas, we put APS in PSPACE
(prior best was EXPSPACE via Grobner basis computation). As an unexpected application of this to
approximative complexity theory we get-- Over any field, hitting-set for $\overline{\rm VP}$
can be designed in PSPACE. This solves an open problem posed in (Mulmuley, FOCS'12, J.AMS 2017);
greatly mitigating the GCT Chasm (exponentially in terms of space complexity).
