The majority of industrial-strength object-oriented (OO) software is written using nominally-typed
OO programming languages. Extant domain-theoretic models of OOP developed to analyze OO type systems
miss, however, a crucial feature of these mainstream OO languages: nominality. This paper presents
the construction of NOOP as the first domain-theoretic model of OOP that includes full class/type
names information found in nominally-typed OOP. Inclusion of nominal information in objects of
NOOP and asserting that type inheritance in statically-typed OO programming languages is an inherently
nominal notion allow readily proving that type inheritance and subtyping are completely identified
in these languages. This conclusion is in full agreement with intuitions of developers and language
designers of these OO languages, and contrary to the belief that "inheritance is not subtyping,"
which came from assuming non-nominal (a.k.a., structural) models of OOP. To motivate the construction
of NOOP, this paper briefly presents the benefits of nominal-typing to mainstream OO developers
and OO language designers, as compared to structural-typing. After presenting NOOP, the paper
further briefly compares NOOP to the most widely known domain-theoretic models of OOP. Leveraging
the development of NOOP, the comparisons presented in this paper provide clear, brief and precise
technical and mathematical accounts for the relation between nominal and structural OO type systems.
NOOP, thus, provides a firmer semantic foundation for analyzing and progressing nominally-typed
OO programming languages.
