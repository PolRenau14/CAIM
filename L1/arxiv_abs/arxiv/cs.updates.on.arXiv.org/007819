We study the following communication variant of local search. There is some fixed, commonly known
graph $G$. Alice holds $f_A$ and Bob holds $f_B$, both are functions that specify a value for each
vertex. The goal is to find a local maximum of $f_A+f_B$ with respect to $G$, i.e., a vertex $v$ for
which $(f_A+f_B)(v)\geq (f_A+f_B)(u)$ for every neighbor $u$ of $v$. Our main result is that finding
a local maximum requires polynomial (in the number of vertices) bits of communication. The result
holds for the following families of graphs: three dimensional grids, hypercubes, odd graphs, and
degree 4 graphs. Moreover, we provide an \emph{optimal} communication bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$
for the hypercube, and for a constant dimensional greed, where $N$ is the number of vertices in the
graph. We provide applications of our main result in two domains, exact potential games and combinatorial
auctions. First, we show that finding a pure Nash equilibrium in $2$-player $N$-action exact potential
games requires polynomial (in $N$) communication. We also show that finding a pure Nash equilibrium
in $n$-player $2$-action exact potential games requires exponential (in $n$) communication.
The second domain that we consider is combinatorial auctions, in which we prove that finding a local
maximum in combinatorial auctions requires exponential (in the number of items) communication
even when the valuations are submodular. Each one of the results demonstrates an exponential separation
between the non-deterministic communication complexity and the randomized communication complexity
of a total search problem.
