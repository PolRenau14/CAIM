In this paper, we analyze the statistics of error signals to assess the perceived quality of images.
Specifically, we focus on the magnitude spectrum of error images obtained from the difference of
reference and distorted images. Analyzing spectral statistics over grayscale images partially
models interference in spatial harmonic distortion exhibited by the visual system but it overlooks
color information, selective and hierarchical nature of visual system. To overcome these shortcomings,
we introduce an image quality assessment algorithm based on the Spectral Understanding of Multi-scale
and Multi-channel Error Representations, denoted as SUMMER. We validate the quality assessment
performance over 3 databases with around 30 distortion types. These distortion types are grouped
into 7 main categories as compression artifact, image noise, color artifact, communication error,
blur, global and local distortions. In total, we benchmark the performance of 17 algorithms along
with the proposed algorithm using 5 performance metrics that measure linearity, monotonicity,
accuracy, and consistency. In addition to experiments with standard performance metrics, we analyze
the distribution of objective and subjective scores with histogram difference metrics and scatter
plots. Moreover, we analyze the classification performance of quality assessment algorithms
along with their statistical significance tests. Based on our experiments, SUMMER significantly
outperforms majority of the compared methods in all benchmark categories
