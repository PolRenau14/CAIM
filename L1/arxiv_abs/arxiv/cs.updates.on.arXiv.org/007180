High Utility Itemset (HUI) mining problem is one of the important problems in the data mining literature.
The problem offers greater flexibility to a decision maker to incorporate her/his notion of utility
into the pattern mining process. The problem, however, requires the decision maker to choose a minimum
utility threshold value for discovering interesting patterns. This is quite challenging due to
the disparate itemset characteristics and their utility distributions. In order to address this
issue, Top-K High Utility Itemset (THUI) mining problem was introduced in the literature. THUI
mining problem is primarily a variant of the HUI mining problem that allows a decision maker to specify
the desired number of HUIs rather than the minimum utility threshold value. Several algorithms
have been introduced in the literature to efficiently mine top-k HUIs. This paper systematically
analyses the top-k HUI mining methods in the literature, describes the methods, and performs a comparative
analysis. The data structures, threshold raising strategies, and pruning strategies adopted
for efficient top-k HUI mining are also presented and analysed. Furthermore, the paper reviews
several extensions of the top-k HUI mining problem such as data stream mining, sequential pattern
mining and on-shelf utility mining. The paper is likely to be useful for researchers to examine the
key methods in top-k HUI mining, evaluate the gaps in literature, explore new research opportunities
and enhance the state-of-the-art in high utility pattern mining.
