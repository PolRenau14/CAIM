Advanced deep learning methods have been developed to conduct prostate MR volume segmentation
in either a 2D or 3D fully convolutional manner. However, 2D methods tend to have limited segmentation
performance, since large amounts of spatial information of prostate volumes are discarded during
the slice-by-slice segmentation process; and 3D methods also have room for improvement, since
they use isotropic kernels to perform 3D convolutions whereas most prostate MR volumes have anisotropic
spatial resolution. Besides, the fully convolutional structural methods achieve good performance
for localization issues but neglect the per-voxel classification for segmentation tasks. In this
paper, we propose a 3D Global Convolutional Adversarial Network (3D GCA-Net) to address efficient
prostate MR volume segmentation. We first design a 3D ResNet encoder to extract 3D features from
prostate scans, and then develop the decoder, which is composed of a multi-scale 3D global convolutional
block and a 3D boundary refinement block, to address the classification and localization issues
simultaneously for volumetric segmentation. Additionally, we combine the encoder-decoder segmentation
network with an adversarial network in the training phrase to enforce the contiguity of long-range
spatial predictions. Throughout the proposed model, we use anisotropic convolutional processing
for better feature learning on prostate MR scans. We evaluated our 3D GCA-Net model on two public
prostate MR datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performances.
