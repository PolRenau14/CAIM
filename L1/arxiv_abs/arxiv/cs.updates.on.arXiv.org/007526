Cumulative exposure to repetitive and forceful activities may lead to musculoskeletal injuries
which not only reduce workers' efficiency and productivity, but also affect their quality of life.
Thus, widely accessible techniques for reliable detection of unsafe muscle force exertion levels
for human activity is necessary for their well-being. However, measurement of force exertion levels
is challenging and the existing techniques pose a great challenge as they are either intrusive,
interfere with human-machine interface, and/or subjective in the nature, thus are not scalable
for all workers. In this work, we use face videos and the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to classify
force exertion levels of 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% (representing rest, moderate effort, and high effort),
thus providing a non-intrusive and scalable approach. Efficient feature extraction approaches
have been investigated, including standard deviation of the movement of different landmarks of
the face, distances between peaks and troughs in the PPG signals. We note that the PPG signals can
be obtained from the face videos, thus giving an efficient classification algorithm for the force
exertion levels using face videos. Based on the data collected from 20 subjects, features extracted
from the face videos give 90\% accuracy in classification among the 100\% and the combination of
0\% and 50\% datasets. Further combining the PPG signals provide 81.7\% accuracy. The approach
is also shown to be robust to the correctly identify force level when the person is talking, even though
such datasets are not included in the training.
