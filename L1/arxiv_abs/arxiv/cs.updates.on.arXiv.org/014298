Accurate Computer-Assisted Diagnosis, relying on large-scale annotated pathological images,
can alleviate the risk of overlooking the diagnosis. Unfortunately, in medical imaging, most available
datasets are small/fragmented. To tackle this, as a Data Augmentation (DA) method, 3D conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize desired realistic/diverse 3D images as
additional training data. However, no 3D conditional GAN-based DA approach exists for general
bounding box-based 3D object detection, while it can locate disease areas with physicians' minimum
annotation cost, unlike rigorous 3D segmentation. Moreover, since lesions vary in position/size/attenuation,
further GAN-based DA performance requires multiple conditions. Therefore, we propose 3D Multi-Conditional
GAN (MCGAN) to generate realistic/diverse 32 X 32 X 32 nodules placed naturally on lung Computed
Tomography images to boost sensitivity in 3D object detection. Our MCGAN adopts two discriminators
for conditioning: the context discriminator learns to classify real vs synthetic nodule/surrounding
pairs with noise box-centered surroundings; the nodule discriminator attempts to classify real
vs synthetic nodules with size/attenuation conditions. The results show that 3D Convolutional
Neural Network-based detection can achieve higher sensitivity under any nodule size/attenuation
at fixed False Positive rates and overcome the medical data paucity with the MCGAN-generated realistic
nodules---even expert physicians fail to distinguish them from the real ones in Visual Turing Test.
