In this paper, a novel technique for tight outer-approximation of the intersection region of a finite
number of ellipses in 2-dimensional (2D) space is proposed. First, the vertices of a tight polygon
that contains the convex intersection of the ellipses are found in an efficient manner. To do so,
the intersection points of the ellipses that fall on the boundary of the intersection region are
determined, and a set of points is generated on the elliptic arcs connecting every two neighbouring
intersection points. By finding the tangent lines to the ellipses at the extended set of points,
a set of half-planes is obtained, whose intersection forms a polygon. To find the polygon more efficiently,
the points are given an order and the intersection of the half-planes corresponding to every two
neighbouring points is calculated. If the polygon is convex and bounded, these calculated points
together with the initially obtained intersection points will form its vertices. If the polygon
is non-convex or unbounded, we can detect this situation and then generate additional discrete
points only on the elliptical arc segment causing the issue, and restart the algorithm to obtain
a bounded and convex polygon. Finally, the smallest area ellipse that contains the vertices of the
polygon is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Through numerical experiments,
it is illustrated that the proposed technique returns a tighter outer-approximation of the intersection
of multiple ellipses, compared to conventional techniques, with only slightly higher computational
cost.
