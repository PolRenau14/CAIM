Supporting ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is a major challenge of 5G wireless
networks. Stringent delay and reliability requirements need to be satisfied for both scheduled
and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to enable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and
media access control layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy only scheduled URLLC traffic,
there is a lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled URLLC traffic, especially in
coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic. Machine learning (ML) is an important enabler for
such a co-existence scenario due to its ability to exploit spatial/temporal correlation in user
behaviors and use of radio resources. Hence, in this paper, we first study the coexistence design
challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM) problem and propose a distributed
risk-aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed solution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal
radio resource slicing, and proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying delay/reliability
requirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to investigate the potential
of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC traffic types. The results further provide insights
on the benefits of leveraging intelligent RRM, e.g. a 75% increase in data rate with respect to the
conservative design approach for the scheduled traffic is achieved, while the 99.99% reliability
of both scheduled and nonscheduled traffic types is satisfied.
