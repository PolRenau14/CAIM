One-time memories (OTM's) are simple tamper-resistant cryptographic devices, which can be used
to implement one-time programs, a very general form of software protection and program obfuscation.
Here we investigate the possibility of building OTM's using quantum mechanical devices. It is known
that OTM's cannot exist in a fully-quantum world or in a fully-classical world. Instead, we propose
a new model based on "isolated qubits" -- qubits that can only be accessed using local operations
and classical communication (LOCC). This model combines a quantum resource (single-qubit measurements)
with a classical restriction (on communication between qubits), and can be implemented using current
technologies, such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this model, we construct OTM's that
are information-theoretically secure against one-pass LOCC adversaries that use 2-outcome measurements.
Our construction resembles Wiesner's old idea of quantum conjugate coding, implemented using
random error-correcting codes; our proof of security uses entropy chaining to bound the supremum
of a suitable empirical process. In addition, we conjecture that our random codes can be replaced
by some class of efficiently-decodable codes, to get computationally-efficient OTM's that are
secure against computationally-bounded LOCC adversaries. In addition, we construct data-hiding
states, which allow an LOCC sender to encode an (n-O(1))-bit messsage into n qubits, such that at
most half of the message can be extracted by a one-pass LOCC receiver, but the whole message can be
extracted by a general quantum receiver.
