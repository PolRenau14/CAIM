In contrast to graph-based models for complex networks, hypergraphs are more general structures
going beyond binary relations of graphs. For graphs, statistics gauging different aspects of their
structures have been devised and there is undergoing research for devising them for hypergraphs.
Forman-Ricci curvature is a statistics for graphs, which is based on Riemannian geometry, and that
stresses the relational character of vertices in a network through the analysis of edges rather
than vertices. In spite of the different applications of this curvature, it has not yet been formulated
for hypergraphs. Here we devise the Forman-Ricci curvature for directed and undirected hypergraphs,
where the curvature for graphs is a particular case. We report its upper and lower bounds and the respective
bounds for the graph case. The curvature quantifies the trade-off between hyperedge(arc) size
and the degree of participation of hyperedge(arc) vertices in other hyperedges(arcs). We calculated
the curvature for two large networks: Wikipedia vote network and \emph{Escherichia coli} metabolic
network. In the first case the curvature is ruled by hyperedge size, while in the second by hyperedge
degree. We found that the number of users involved in Wikipedia elections goes hand-in-hand with
the participation of experienced users. The curvature values of the metabolic network allowed
detecting redundant and bottle neck reactions. It is found that ADP phosphorilation is the metabolic
bottle neck reaction but that the reverse reaction is not that central for the metabolism.
