With the emergence of millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communication technology, the capacity of mobile
backhaul networks can be significantly increased. On the other hand, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
provides an appropriate infrastructure to offload latency-sensitive tasks. However, the amount
of resources in MEC servers is typically limited. Therefore, it is important to intelligently manage
the MEC task offloading by optimizing the backhaul bandwidth and edge server resource allocation
in order to decrease the overall latency of the offloaded tasks. This paper investigates the task
allocation problem in MEC environment, where the mmWave technology is used in the backhaul network.
We formulate a Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem with the goal to minimize the
total task serving time. Its objective is to determine an optimized network topology, identify
which server is used to process a given offloaded task, find the path of each user task, and determine
the allocated bandwidth to each task on mmWave backhaul links. Because the problem is difficult
to solve, we develop a two-step approach. First, a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) determining
the network topology and the routing paths is optimally solved. Then, the fractions of bandwidth
allocated to each user task are optimized by solving a quasi-convex problem. Numerical results
illustrate the obtained topology and routing paths for selected scenarios and show that optimizing
the bandwidth allocation significantly improves the total serving time, particularly for bandwidth-intensive
tasks.
