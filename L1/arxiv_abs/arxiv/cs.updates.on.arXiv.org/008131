Computed tomography imaging is well accepted for its imaging speed, image contrast & resolution
and cost. Thus it has wide use in detection and diagnosis of brain diseases. But unfortunately reported
works on CT segmentation is not very significant. In this paper, a robust automatic segmentation
system is presented which is capable of segment complete brain matter from CT slices, without any
lose in information. The proposed method is simple, fast, accurate and completely automatic. It
can handle multislice CT scan in single run. From a given multislice CT dataset, one slice is selected
automatically to form masks for segmentation. Two types of masks are created to handle nasal slices
in a better way. Masks are created from selected reference slice using automatic seed point selection
and region growing technique. One mask is designed for brain matter and another includes the skull
of the reference slice. This second mask is used as global reference mask for all slices whereas the
brain matter mask is implemented on only adjacent slices and continuously modified for better segmentation.
Slices in given dataset are divided into two batches, before reference slice and after reference
slice. Each batch segmented separately. Successive propagation of brain matter mask has demonstrated
very high potential in reported segmentation. Presented result shows highest sensitivity and
more than 96% accuracy in all cases. Resulted segmented images can be used for any brain disease diagnosis
or further image analysis.
