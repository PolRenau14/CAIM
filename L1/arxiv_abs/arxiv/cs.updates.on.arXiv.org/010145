IoT devices are increasingly being implicated in cyber-attacks, raising community concern about
the risks they pose to critical infrastructure, corporations, and citizens. In order to reduce
this risk, the IETF is pushing IoT vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose
of their IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that their network
behavior in any operating environment can be locked down and verified rigorously. This paper aims
to assist IoT manufacturers in developing and verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters
of these devices to ensure they are compatible with their organizational policies and track devices
network behavior based on their MUD profile. Our first contribution is to develop a tool that takes
the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input and automatically generates the MUD profile
for it. We contribute our tool as open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights
and challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a formal semantic
framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for consistency, but also checks its compatibility
with a given organizational policy. We apply our framework to representative organizations and
selected devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT acceptance testing.
Finally, we show how operators can dynamically identify IoT devices using known MUD profiles and
monitor their behavioral changes on their network.
