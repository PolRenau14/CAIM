This study applies a technique to expand the number of images to a level that allows deep learning.
And the applicability of the Sauvegrain method through deep learning with relatively few elbow
X-rays is studied. The study was composed of processes similar to the physicians' bone age assessment
procedures. The selected reference images were learned without being included in the evaluation
data, and at the same time, the data was extended to accommodate the number of cases. In addition,
we adjusted the X-ray images to better images using U-Net and selected the ROI with RPN + so as to be
able to perform bone age estimation through CNN. The mean absolute error of the Sauvegrain method
based on deep learning is 2.8 months and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is 0.018. This
result shows that X - ray analysis using the Sauvegrain method shows higher accuracy than that of
the age group of puberty even in the deep learning base. This means that deep learning of the Suvegrain
method can be measured at a level similar to that of an expert, based on the extended X-ray image with
the image data extension technique. Finally, we applied the Sauvegrain method to deep learning
for accurate measurement of bone age at puberty. As a result, the present study is based on deep learning,
and compared with the evaluation results of experts, it is possible to overcome limitations of the
method of measuring bone age based on machine learning which was in TW3 or Greulich & Pyle due to lack
of X- I confirmed the fact. And we also presented the Sauvegrain method, which is applicable to adolescents
as well.
