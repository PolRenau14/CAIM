The logistic normal distribution has recently been adapted via the transformation of multivariate
Gaus- sian variables to model the topical distribution of documents in the presence of correlations
among topics. In this paper, we propose a probit normal alternative approach to modelling correlated
topical structures. Our use of the probit model in the context of topic discovery is novel, as many
authors have so far con- centrated solely of the logistic model partly due to the formidable inefficiency
of the multinomial probit model even in the case of very small topical spaces. We herein circumvent
the inefficiency of multinomial probit estimation by using an adaptation of the diagonal orthant
multinomial probit in the topic models context, resulting in the ability of our topic modelling
scheme to handle corpuses with a large number of latent topics. An additional and very important
benefit of our method lies in the fact that unlike with the logistic normal model whose non-conjugacy
leads to the need for sophisticated sampling schemes, our ap- proach exploits the natural conjugacy
inherent in the auxiliary formulation of the probit model to achieve greater simplicity. The application
of our proposed scheme to a well known Associated Press corpus not only helps discover a large number
of meaningful topics but also reveals the capturing of compellingly intuitive correlations among
certain topics. Besides, our proposed approach lends itself to even further scalability thanks
to various existing high performance algorithms and architectures capable of handling millions
of documents.
