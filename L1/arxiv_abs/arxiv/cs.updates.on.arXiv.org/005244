Recently, many online social networks, such as MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster, have faced inactivity
decay of their members, which contributed to the collapse of these networks. The reasons, mechanics,
and prevention mechanisms of such inactivity decay are not fully understood. In this work, we analyze
decayed and alive sub-websites from the StackExchange platform. The analysis mainly focuses on
the inactivity cascades that occur among the members of these communities. We provide measures
to understand the decay process and statistical analysis to extract the patterns that accompany
the inactivity decay. Additionally, we predict cascade size and cascade virality using machine
learning. The results of this work include a statistically significant difference of the decay
patterns between the decayed and the alive sub-websites. These patterns are mainly: cascade size,
cascade virality, cascade duration, and cascade similarity. Additionally, the contributed prediction
framework showed satisfactory prediction results compared to a baseline predictor. Supported
by empirical evidence, the main findings of this work are: (1) the decay process is not governed by
only one network measure; it is better described using multiple measures; (2) the expert members
of the StackExchange sub-websites were mainly responsible for the activity or inactivity of the
StackExchange sub-websites; (3) the Statistics sub-website is going through decay dynamics that
may lead to it becoming fully-decayed; and (4) decayed sub-websites were originally less resilient
to inactivity decay, unlike the alive sub-websites.
