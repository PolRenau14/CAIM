In this paper, we investigate the design of a pilot spoofing attack (PSA) carried out by multiple
single-antenna eavesdroppers (Eves) in a downlink time-division duplex (TDD) system, where a
multiple antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential information to a single-antenna legitimate
user (LU). During the uplink channel training phase, multiple Eves collaboratively impair the
channel acquisition of the legitimate link, aiming at maximizing the wiretapping signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in the subsequent downlink data transmission phase. Two different scenarios are investigated:
(1) the BS is unaware of the PSA, and (2) the BS attempts to detect the presence of the PSA. For both scenarios,
we formulate wiretapping SNR maximization problems. For the second scenario, we also investigate
the probability of successful detection and constrain it to remain below a pre-designed threshold.
The two resulting optimization problems can be unified into a more general non-convex optimization
problem, and we propose an efficient algorithm based on the minorization-maximization (MM) method
and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. The proposed MM-ADMM algorithm
is shown to converge to a stationary point of the general problem. In addition, we propose a semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) method as a benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of the MM-ADMM algorithm. Numerical
results show that the MM-ADMM algorithm achieves near-optimal performance and is computationally
more efficient than the SDRbased method.
