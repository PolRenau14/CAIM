Experimental data availability is a cornerstone for reproducibility in experimental fracture
mechanics, which is crucial to the scientific method. This short communication focuses on the accessibility
and long term availability of raw experimental data. The corresponding authors of the eleven most
cited papers, related to experimental fracture mechanics, for every year from 2000 up to 2016, were
kindly asked about the availability of the raw experimental data associated with each publication.
For the 187 e-mails sent: 22.46% resulted in outdated contact information, 57.75% of the authors
did received our request and did not reply, and 19.79 replied to our request. The availability of
data is generally low with only $11$ available data sets (5.9%). The authors identified two main
issues for the lacking availability of raw experimental data. First, the ability to retrieve data
is strongly attached to the the possibility to contact the corresponding author. This study suggests
that institutional e-mail addresses are insufficient means for obtaining experimental data sets.
Second, lack of experimental data is also due that submission and publication does not require to
make the raw experimental data available. The following solutions are proposed: (1) Requirement
of unique identifiers, like ORCID or ResearcherID, to detach the author(s) from their institutional
e-mail address, (2) Provide DOIs, like Zenodo or Dataverse, to make raw experimental data citable,
and (3) grant providing organizations should ensure that experimental data by public funded projects
is available to the public.
