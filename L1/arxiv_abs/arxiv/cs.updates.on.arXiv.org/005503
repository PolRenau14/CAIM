Given a set of $n$ points $P$ in the plane, each colored with one of the $t$ given colors, a color-spanning
set $S\subset P$ is a subset of $t$ points with distinct colors. The minimum diameter color-spanning
set (MDCS) is a color-spanning set whose diameter is minimum (among all color-spanning sets of $P$).
Somehow symmetrically, the largest closest pair color-spanning set (LCPCS) is a color-spanning
set whose closest pair is the largest (among all color-spanning sets of $P$). Both MDCS and LCPCS
have been shown to be NP-complete, but whether they are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when $t$
is a parameter is still open. Motivated by this question, we consider the FPT tractability of some
matching problems under this color-spanning model, where $t=2k$ is the parameter. The problems
are summarized as follows: (1) MinSum Matching Color-Spanning Set, namely, computing a matching
of $2k$ points with distinct colors such that their total edge length is minimized; (2) MaxMin Matching
Color-Spanning Set, namely, computing a matching of $2k$ points with distinct colors such that
the minimum edge length is maximized; (3) MinMax Matching Color-Spanning Set, namely, computing
a matching of $2k$ points with distinct colors such that the maximum edge length is minimized; and
(4) $k$-Multicolored Independent Matching, namely, computing a matching of $2k$ vertices in a
graph such that the vertices of the edges in the matching do not share common edges in the graph. We
show that the first three problems are polynomially solvable (hence in FPT), while problem (4) is
W[1]-hard.
