This article is a contribution towards an understanding of Open Access (OA) publishing. It proposes
an analysis framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of Bibliographic information,
Activity metrics, Economics, Accessibility, and Predatory issues of OA journals. The framework
has been employed in a systematic analysis of 30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information
systems (IS), which were selected among 386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of
OA Journals. An analysis is performed on the sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the
current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS. The journals are then compared between-group,
according to the presence of a publication fee. A within-group analysis is performed on the journals
requesting publication charges to authors, in order to understand what is the value added according
to different price ranges. This article offers several contributions. It presents an overview
of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born from the observation of data
and the literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS while offering a first analysis.
Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper highlights several
concerns still threatening OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among them, it is shown that high
publication fees are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which often lack transparency
and may prevent authors from adopting OA.
