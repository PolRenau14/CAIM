We investigate the complexity of deciding, given a multiplication table representing a semigroup
S, a subset X of S and an element t of S, whether t can be expressed as a product of elements of X. It is well-known
that this problem is NL-complete and that the more general Cayley groupoid membership problem,
where the multiplication table is not required to be associative, is P-complete. For groups, the
problem can be solved in deterministic log-space which raised the question of determining the exact
complexity of this variant. Barrington, Kadau, Lange and McKenzie showed that for Abelian groups
and for certain solvable groups, the problem is contained in the complexity class FOLL and they concluded
that these variants are not hard for any complexity class containing PARITY. The more general case
of arbitrary groups remained open. In this work, we show that for both groups and for commutative
semigroups, the problem is solvable in qAC^0 (quasi-polynomial size circuits of constant depth
with unbounded fan-in) and conclude that these variants are also not hard for any class containing
PARITY. Moreover, we prove that NL-completeness already holds for the classes of 0-simple semigroups
and nilpotent semigroups. Together with our results on groups and commutative semigroups, this
allows us to show that there is no natural complexity class which includes qAC^0, is strictly contained
in NL and corresponds to a restriction of the Cayley semigroup membership problem to a variety of
semigroups. We also discuss applications of our technique to FOLL.
