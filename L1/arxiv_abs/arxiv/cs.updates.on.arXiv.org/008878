Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technologies with thermally unstable nanomagnets
are leveraged to develop an intrinsic stochastic neuron as a building block for restricted Boltzmann
machines (RBMs) to form deep belief networks (DBNs). The embedded MRAM-based neuron is modeled
using precise physics equations. The simulation results exhibit the desired sigmoidal relation
between the input voltages and probability of the output state. A probabilistic inference network
simulator (PIN-Sim) is developed to realize a circuit-level model of an RBM utilizing resistive
crossbar arrays along with differential amplifiers to implement the positive and negative weight
values. The PIN-Sim is composed of five main blocks to train a DBN, evaluate its accuracy, and measure
its power consumption. The MNIST dataset is leveraged to investigate the energy and accuracy tradeoffs
of seven distinct network topologies in SPICE using the 14nm HP-FinFET technology library with
the nominal voltage of 0.8V, in which an MRAM-based neuron is used as the activation function. The
software and hardware level simulations indicate that a $784\times200\times10$ topology can
achieve less than 5% error rates with $\sim400 pJ$ energy consumption. The error rates can be reduced
to 2.5% by using a $784\times500\times500\times500\times10$ DBN at the cost of $\sim10\times$
higher energy consumption and significant area overhead. Finally, the effects of specific hardware-level
parameters on power dissipation and accuracy tradeoffs are identified via the developed PIN-Sim
framework.
