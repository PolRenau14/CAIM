Bioinformatics tools have been developed to interpret gene expression data at the gene set level,
and these gene set based analyses improve the biologists' capability to discover functional relevance
of their experiment design. While elucidating gene set individually, inter gene sets association
is rarely taken into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging machine learning technique in computational
biology, can be used to generate an unbiased combination of gene set, and to determine the biological
relevance and analysis consistency of these combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data
sets. In this study, we proposed a gene superset autoencoder (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder
model with the incorporation of a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial biological features
in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the gene superset, an unbiased combination of gene
sets with weights trained by the autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer is a superset. Trained
with genomic data from TCGA and evaluated with their accompanying clinical parameters, we showed
gene supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes and their prognostic capability. We
further demonstrated the biological relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant
supersets. Using autoencoder model and gene superset at its latent layer, we demonstrated that
gene supersets retain sufficient biological information with respect to tumor subtypes and clinical
prognostic significance. Superset also provides high reproducibility on survival analysis and
accurate prediction for cancer subtypes.
