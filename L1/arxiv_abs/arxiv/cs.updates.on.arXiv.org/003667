We consider the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Claude Shannon in 1941 as
a mathematical model of Differential Analysers, that is to say as a model of continuous-time analog
(mechanical, and later one electronic) machines of that time. We extend the model properly to a model
of computation not restricted to univariate functions (i.e. functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$)
but also to the multivariate case of (i.e. functions $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$), and establish
some basic properties. In particular, we prove that a very wide class of (continuous and discontinuous)
functions can be uniformly approximated over their full domain. Technically: we generalize some
known results about the GPAC to the multidimensional case: we extend naturally the notion of \emph{generable}
function, from the unidimensional to the multidimensional case. We prove a few stability properties
of this class, mostly stability by arithmetic operations, composition and ODE solving. We establish
that generable functions are always analytic. We prove that generable functions include some basic
(useful) generable functions, and that we can (uniformly) approximate a wide range of functions
this way. This extends some of the results from \cite{Sha41} to the multidimensional case, and this
also strengths the approximation result from \cite{Sha41} over a compact domain to a uniform approximation
result over unbounded domains. We also discuss the issue of constants, and we prove that involved
constants can basically assumed to always be polynomial time computable numbers.
