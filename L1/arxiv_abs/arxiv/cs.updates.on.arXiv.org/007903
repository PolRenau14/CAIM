Social networking services have attracted millions of users, including individuals, professionals,
and companies, that upload massive amounts of content, such as text, pictures, and video, every
day. Content creators retain the intellectual property (IP) rights on the content they share with
these networks, however, very frequently they implicitly grant them, a sometimes, overly broad
license to use that content, which enables the services to use it in possibly undesirable ways. For
instance, Facebook claims a transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license
on all user-provided content. Professional content creators, like photographers, are particularly
affected. In this paper we propose a design for decoupling user data from social networking services
without any loss of functionality for the users. Our design suggests that user data are kept off the
social networking service, in third parties that enable the hosting of user-generated content
under terms of service and overall environment (e.g., a different location) that better suit the
user's needs and wishes. At the same time, indirection schemata are seamlessly integrated in the
social networking service, without any cooperation from the server side necessary, so that users
can transparently access the off-site data just as they would if hosted in-site. We have implemented
our design as an extension for the Chrome Web browser, called Redirect2Own, and show that it incurs
negligible overhead on accessing 'redirected' content. We offer the extension as free software
and its code as an open-source project.
