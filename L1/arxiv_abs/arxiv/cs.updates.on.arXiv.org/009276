Kirigami tessellations, regular planar patterns formed by cutting flat, thin sheets, have attracted
recent scientific interest for their rich geometries, surprising material properties and promise
for technologies. Here we pose and solve the inverse problem of designing the number, size, and orientation
of cuts that allows us to convert a closed, compact regular kirigami tessellation of the plane into
a deployment that conforms approximately to any prescribed target shape in two and three dimensions.
We do this by first identifying the constraints on the lengths and angles of generalized kirigami
tessellations which guarantee that their reconfigured face geometries can be contracted from
a non-trivial deployed shape to a novel planar cut pattern. We encode these conditions in a flexible
constrained optimization framework which allows us to deform the geometry of periodic kirigami
tesselations with three, four, and sixfold symmetry, among others, into generalized kirigami
patterns that deploy to a wide variety of prescribed boundary target shapes. Physically fabricated
models verify our inverse design approach and allow us to determine the tunable material response
of the resulting structures. We then extend our framework to create generalized kirigami patterns
that deploy to approximate curved surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Altogether, this work illustrates
a novel framework for designing complex, shape-changing sheets from simple cuts showing the power
of kirigami tessellations as flexible mechanical metamaterials.
