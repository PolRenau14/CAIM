In this paper, we revisit the stability region of a cellular time division duplex (TDD) network.
We characterize the queuing stability region of a network model that consists of two types of communications:
(i) users communicating with the base station and (ii) users communicating with each other by passing
through the base station. When a communication passes through the base station (BS) then a packet
cannot be delivered to the destination UE until it is first received by the BS queue from the source
UE. Due to the relaying functionality at the BS level, a coupling is created between the queues of
the source users and the BS queues. In addition, contrarily to the majority of the existing works
where an ON/OFF model of transmission is considered, we assume a link adaptation model (i.e. multiple
rate model) where the bit rate of a link depends on its radio conditions. The coupling between the
queues as well as the multiple rate model are the main challenges that highly increase the complexity
of the stability region characterization. In this paper, we propose a simple approach that permits
to overcome these challenges and to provide a full characterization of the exact stability region
as a convex polytope with a finite number of vertices. An approximated model is proposed for reducing
the computational complexity of the exact stability region. For the multi-user scenario, a trade-off
is established between the complexity and the preciseness of the approximated stability region
compared to the exact one. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to corroborate our claims.
