We consider a system where a human operator processes a sequence of tasks that are similar in nature
under a total time constraint. In these systems, the performance of the operator depends on its past
utilization. This is akin to $\textit{state-dependent}$ channels where the past actions of the
transmitter affects the future quality of the channel (also known as $\textit{action-dependent}$
or $\textit{use-dependent}$ channels). For $\textit{human channels}$, a well-known psychological
phenomena, known as $\textit{Yerkes-Dodson law}$, states that a human operator performs worse
when he/she is over-utilized or under-utilized. Over such a $\textit{use-dependent}$ human channel,
we consider the problem of maximizing a utility function, which is monotonically increasing and
concave in the time allocated for each task, under explicit minimum and maximum $\textit{utilization}$
constraints. We show that the optimal solution is to keep the utilization ratio of the operator as
high as possible, and to process all the tasks. We prove that the optimal policy consists of two major
strategies: utilize the operator without resting until reaching the maximum allowable utilization
ratio, and then alternate between working and resting the operator each time reaching the maximum
allowable utilization at the end of work-period. We show that even though the tasks are similar in
difficulty, the time allocated for the tasks can be different depending on the strategy in which
a task is processed; however, the tasks processed in the same strategy are processed equally.
