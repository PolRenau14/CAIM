Ontology authoring is a complex process, where commonly the automated reasoner is invoked for verification
of newly introduced changes, therewith amounting to a time-consuming test-last approach. Test-Driven
Development (TDD) for ontology authoring is a recent {\em test-first} approach that aims to reduce
authoring time and increase authoring efficiency. Current TDD testing falls short on coverage
of OWL features and possible test outcomes, the rigorous foundation thereof, and evaluations to
ascertain its effectiveness. We aim to address these issues in one instantiation of TDD for ontology
authoring. We first propose a succinct, logic-based model of TDD testing and present novel TDD algorithms
so as to cover also any OWL 2 class expression for the TBox and for the principal ABox assertions, and
prove their correctness. The algorithms use methods from the OWL API directly such that reclassification
is not necessary for test execution, therewith reducing ontology authoring time. The algorithms
were implemented in TDDonto2, a Prot\'eg\'e plugin. TDDonto2 was evaluated on editing efficiency
and by users. The editing efficiency study demonstrated that it is faster than a typical ontology
authoring interface, especially for medium size and large ontologies. The user evaluation demonstrated
that modellers make significantly less errors with TDDonto2 compared to the standard Prot\'eg\'e
interface and complete their tasks better using less time. Thus, the results indicate that Test-Driven
Development is a promising approach in an ontology development methodology.
