We present a novel approach that enables photo-realistic re-animation of portrait videos using
only an input video. In contrast to existing approaches that are restricted to manipulations of
facial expressions only, we are the first to transfer the full 3D head position, head rotation, face
expression, eye gaze, and eye blinking from a source actor to a portrait video of a target actor. The
core of our approach is a generative neural network with a novel space-time architecture. The network
takes as input synthetic renderings of a parametric face model, based on which it predicts photo-realistic
video frames for a given target actor. The realism in this rendering-to-video transfer is achieved
by careful adversarial training, and as a result, we can create modified target videos that mimic
the behavior of the synthetically-created input. In order to enable source-to-target video re-animation,
we render a synthetic target video with the reconstructed head animation parameters from a source
video, and feed it into the trained network -- thus taking full control of the target. With the ability
to freely recombine source and target parameters, we are able to demonstrate a large variety of video
rewrite applications without explicitly modeling hair, body or background. For instance, we can
reenact the full head using interactive user-controlled editing, and realize high-fidelity visual
dubbing. To demonstrate the high quality of our output, we conduct an extensive series of experiments
and evaluations, where for instance a user study shows that our video edits are hard to detect.
