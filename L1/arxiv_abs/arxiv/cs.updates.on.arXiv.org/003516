We study the problem of two-user Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) in the presence of an external
eavesdropper. In this problem, an eavesdropper receives a signal with a lower signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) compared to the legitimate receiver and all transmitted messages should be kept confidential
against the eavesdropper. For this purpose, we propose a secure coding scheme on this channel which
utilizes low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by employing random bit insertion and puncturing
techniques. At each encoder, the confidential message with some random bits as a random message
are systematically encoded, and then the associated bits to the confidential message are punctured.
Next, the encoders send their unpunctured bits over a Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel
(GMAC-WT). The puncturing distribution applied to the LDPC code is considered in two cases: random
and optimized. We utilize a modified extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to optimize
the puncturing distribution for each encoder. The security gap is used as a measure of secrecy for
the sent messages over GMAC-WT which should be made as small as possible. We compare the achieved
secure rate pair with an achievable secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT to show the effective performance
of the proposed scheme. In this paper, equal and unequal power conditions at the transmitters are
investigated. For both cases, we attain a fairly small security gap which is equivalent to achieve
the points near the secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT.
