Oral Disintegrating Tablets (ODTs) is a novel dosage form that can be dissolved on the tongue within
3min or less especially for geriatric and pediatric patients. Current ODT formulation studies
usually rely on the personal experience of pharmaceutical experts and trial-and-error in the laboratory,
which is inefficient and time-consuming. The aim of current research was to establish the prediction
model of ODT formulations with direct compression process by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and
Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques. 145 formulation data were extracted from Web of Science.
All data sets were divided into three parts: training set (105 data), validation set (20) and testing
set (20). ANN and DNN were compared for the prediction of the disintegrating time. The accuracy of
the ANN model has reached 85.60%, 80.00% and 75.00% on the training set, validation set and testing
set respectively, whereas that of the DNN model was 85.60%, 85.00% and 80.00%, respectively. Compared
with the ANN, DNN showed the better prediction for ODT formulations. It is the first time that deep
neural network with the improved dataset selection algorithm is applied to formulation prediction
on small data. The proposed predictive approach could evaluate the critical parameters about quality
control of formulation, and guide research and process development. The implementation of this
prediction model could effectively reduce drug product development timeline and material usage,
and proactively facilitate the development of a robust drug product.
