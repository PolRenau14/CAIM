Although feature models are widely used in practice, for example, representing variability in
software product lines, their integration is still a challenge. Many integration techniques have
been proposed, although none of these have proven to be fully effective. Integrating feature models
becomes a difficult, costly, error-prone task. Since their transition occurs in a generalized
and automated way, the techniques applied to compose the models end up giving rise to a final model,
in many cases undesired, without taking into account the specific needs arising from the requirements
determined by the analysts and developers. Therefore, this work proposes FMIT, a technique for
integrating feature models. The FMIT is based on contemporary model integration strategies to
increase the accuracy and quality of the integrated feature model. In this way, it will be possible
to identify the degree of similarity between composite feature diagrams, to verify their accuracy,
as well as to identify conflicts. In addition, this work proposes the development of a prototype
based on the set of strategies, used to take decisions according to the requirements established
during the integration of feature models, whether this is semi-automatic or automatic. To evaluate
FMIT, experimental studies were conducted with 10 participants, including students and professionals.
Participants performed 12 integration scenarios, 6 using the FMIT and 6 manually. The results suggest
that FMIT improved accuracy by 43\% of the cases, as well as reduced the effort by 70\% to perform the
integrations.
