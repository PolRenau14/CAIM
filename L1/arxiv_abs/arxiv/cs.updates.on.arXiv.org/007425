We introduce a novel approach to visualizing temporal clickstream behaviour in the context of a
degree-satisfying online course, Habitable Worlds, offered through Arizona State University.
The current practice for visualizing behaviour within a digital learning environment has been
to generate plots based on hand engineered or coded features using domain knowledge. While this
approach has been effective in relating behavior to known phenomena, features crafted from domain
knowledge are not likely well suited to make unfamiliar phenomena salient and thus can preclude
discovery. We introduce a methodology for organically surfacing behavioral regularities from
clickstream data, conducting an expert in-the-loop hyperparameter search, and identifying anticipated
as well as newly discovered patterns of behavior. While these visualization techniques have been
used before in the broader machine learning community to better understand neural networks and
relationships between word vectors, we apply them to online behavioural learner data and go a step
further; exploring the impact of the parameters of the model on producing tangible, non-trivial
observations of behaviour that are suggestive of pedagogical improvement to the course designers
and instructors. The methodology introduced in this paper led to an improved understanding of passing
and non-passing student behaviour in the course and is widely applicable to other datasets of clickstream
activity where investigators and stakeholders wish to organically surface principal patterns
of behavior.
