Technological advancement has brought revolutionary change in the converged wireless networks.
Due to the existence of different types of traffic, provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes
a challenge in the wireless networks. In case of a congested network, resource allocation has emerged
as an effective way to provide the excessive users with desirable QoS. Since QoS for non-real-time
traffic are not as strict as for real-time traffic, the unoccupied channels of the adjacent cells
can be assigned to the non-real-time traffic to retain QoS for real-time traffic. This results in
the intensified bandwidth utilization as well as less interference for the real-time traffic.
In this paper, we propose an effective radio resource management scheme that relies on the dynamically
assigned bandwidth allocation process. In case of interference management, we classify the traffic
into real-time traffic and non-real-time traffic and give priority to the real-time traffic. According
to our scheme, the real-time traffic among the excessive number of users are reassigned to the original
channels which have been occupied by non-real-time traffic and the non-real-time traffic are allocated
to the assigned channels of those real-time traffic. The architecture allows improved signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for real-time traffic along with intensification in the bandwidth
utilization of the network. Besides, the increased system capacity and lower outage probability
of the network bear the significance of the proposed scheme.
