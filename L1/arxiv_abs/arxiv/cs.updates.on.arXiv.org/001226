We propose an intuitive, simple and hardware friendly, yet surprisingly novel and efficient, received
signal's angle of arrival (AoA) estimation scheme. Our intuitive, two-phases cross-correlation
based scheme relies on a switched beam antenna array, which is used to collect an omni-directional
signal using few elements of the antenna array in the first phase. In the second phase, the scheme
switches the main beam of the antenna array to scan the angular region of interest. The collected
signal from each beam (direction or angle) is cross correlated with the omni-directional signal.
The cross-correlation coefficient will be the highest at the correct AoA and relatively negligible
elsewhere. The proposed scheme simplicity stems from its low computational complexity (only cross-correlation
and comparison operations are required) and its independence of the transmitted signal structure
(does not require information about the transmitted signal). The proposed scheme requires a receiver
with switched beam antenna array, which can be attached to a single radio frequency chain through
phase shifters, hence, its hardware friendliness. The high efficiency of our system can be observed
by comparing its performance with the literature's best performing MUSIC algorithm. The comparison
demonstrates that our scheme outperforms the MUSIC algorithm, specially at low SNR levels. Moreover,
the number of sources that can be detected using our scheme is bound by the number of switched beams,
rather than the number of antenna elements in the case of the MUSIC algorithm.
