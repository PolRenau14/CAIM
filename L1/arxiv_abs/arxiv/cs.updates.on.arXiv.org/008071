Meaning may arise from an element's role or interactions within a larger system. For example, hitting
nails is more central to people's concept of a hammer than its particular material composition or
other intrinsic features. Likewise, the importance of a web page may result from its links with other
pages rather than solely from its content. One example of meaning arising from extrinsic relationships
are approaches that extract the meaning of word concepts from co-occurrence patterns in large,
text corpora. The success of these methods suggest that human activity patterns may reveal conceptual
organization. However, texts do not directly reflect human activity, but instead serve a communicative
function and are usually highly curated or edited to suit an audience. Here, we apply methods devised
for text to a data source that directly reflects thousands of individuals' activity patterns, namely
supermarket purchases. Using product co-occurrence data from nearly 1.3m shopping baskets, we
trained a topic model to learn 25 high-level concepts (or "topics"). These topics were found to be
comprehensible and coherent by both retail experts and consumers. Topics ranged from specific
(e.g., ingredients for a stir-fry) to general (e.g., cooking from scratch). Topics tended to be
goal-directed and situational, consistent with the notion that human conceptual knowledge is
tailored to support action. Individual differences in the topics sampled predicted basic demographic
characteristics. These results suggest that human activity patterns reveal conceptual organization
and may give rise to it.
