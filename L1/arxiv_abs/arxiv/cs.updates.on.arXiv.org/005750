The focus of this paper is on the evaluation of sixteen labeling methods for hierarchical document
clusters over five datasets. All of the methods are independent from clustering algorithms, applied
subsequently to the dendrogram construction and based on probabilistic dependence relations
among labels and clusters. To reach a fair comparison as well as a standard benchmark, we rewrote
and presented the labeling methods in a similar notation. The experimental results were analyzed
through a proposed evaluation methodology based on: (i) data standardization before applying
the cluster labeling methods and over the labeling results; (ii) a particular information retrieval
process, using the obtained labels and their hierarchical relations to construct the search queries;
(iii) evaluation of the retrieval process through precision, recall and F measure; (iv) variance
analysis of the retrieval results to better understanding the differences among the labeling methods;
and, (v) the emulation of a human judgment through the analysis of a topic observed coherence measure
- normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). Applying the methodology, we are able to highlight
the advantages of certain methods: to capture specific information; for a better document hierarchy
comprehension at different levels of granularity; and, to capture the most coherent labels through
the label selections. Finally, the experimental results demonstrated that the label selection
methods which hardly consider hierarchical relations had the best results.
