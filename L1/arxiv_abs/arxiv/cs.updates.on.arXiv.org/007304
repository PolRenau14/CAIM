Facial recognition has always been a challeng- ing task for computer vision scientists and experts.
Despite complexities arising due to variations in camera parameters, illumination and face orientations,
significant progress has been made in the field with deep learning algorithms now competing with
human-level accuracy. But in contrast to the recent advances in face recognition techniques, Disguised
Facial Identification continues to be a tougher challenge in the field of computer vision. The modern
day scenario, where security is of prime concern, regular face identification techniques do not
perform as required when the faces are disguised, which calls for a different approach to handle
situations where intruders have their faces masked. Along the same lines, we propose a deep learning
architecture for disguised facial recognition (DFR). The algorithm put forward in this paper detects
20 facial key-points in the first stage, using a 14-layered convolutional neural network (CNN).
These facial key-points are later utilized by a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying the
disguised faces based on the euclidean distance ratios and angles between different facial key-points.
This overall architecture imparts a basic intelligence to our system. Our key-point feature prediction
accuracy is 65% while the classification rate is 72.4%. Moreover, the architecture works at 19 FPS,
thereby performing in almost real-time. The efficiency of our approach is also compared with the
state-of-the-art Disguised Facial Identification methods.
