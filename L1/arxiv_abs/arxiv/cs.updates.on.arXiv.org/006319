Robust navigation in urban environments has received a considerable amount of both academic and
commercial interest over recent years. This is primarily due to large commercial organizations
such as Google and Uber stepping into the autonomous navigation market. Most of this research has
shied away from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based navigation. The aversion to utilizing
GNSS data is due to the degraded nature of the data in urban environment (e.g., multipath, poor satellite
visibility). The degradation of the GNSS data in urban environments makes it such that traditional
(GNSS) positioning methods (e.g., extended Kalman filter, particle filters) perform poorly.
However, recent advances in robust graph theoretic based sensor fusion methods, primarily applied
to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based robotic applications, can also be applied
to GNSS data processing. This paper will utilize one such method known as the factor graph in conjunction
several robust optimization techniques to evaluate their applicability to robust GNSS data processing.
The goals of this study are two-fold. First, for GNSS applications, we will experimentally evaluate
the effectiveness of robust optimization techniques within a graph-theoretic estimation framework.
Second, by releasing the software developed and data sets used for this study, we will introduce
a new open-source front-end to the Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping (GTSAM) library for the purpose
of integrating GNSS pseudorange observations.
