Human cognition is a complex process facilitated by the intricate architecture of human brain.
However, human cognition is often reduced to quantum theory based events in principle because of
their correlative conjectures for the purpose of analysis for reciprocal understanding. In this
paper, we begin our analysis of human cognition via formal methods and proceed towards quantum theories.
Human cognition often violate classic probabilities on which formal representation of conceptual
spaces are built. Further, geometric representation of conceptual spaces proposed by Gardenfors
discusses the underlying content but lacks a systematic approach (Gardenfors, 2000; Kitto et.
al, 2012). However, the aforementioned views are not contradictory but different perspective
with a gap towards sufficient understanding of human cognitive process. A comprehensive and systematic
approach to model a relatively complex scenario can be addressed by vector space approach of conceptual
spaces as discussed in literature. In this research, we have proposed an approach that uses both
formal representation and Gardenfors geometric approach. The proposed model of high dimensional
formal representation of conceptual space is mathematically analysed and inferred to exhibit
quantum aspects. Also, the proposed model achieves cognition, in particular, consciousness.
We have demonstrated this process of achieving consciousness with a constructive learning scenario.
We have also proposed an algorithm for conceptual scaling of a real world scenario under different
quality dimensions to obtain a conceptual scale.
