Existential rules, long known as tuple-generating dependencies in database theory, have been
intensively studied in the last decade as a powerful formalism to represent ontological knowledge
in the context of ontology-based query answering. A knowledge base is then composed of an instance
that contains incomplete data and a set of existential rules, and answers to queries are logically
entailed from the knowledge base. This brought again to light the fundamental chase tool, and its
different variants that have been proposed in the literature. It is well-known that the problem
of determining, given a chase variant and a set of existential rules, whether the chase will halt
on any instance, is undecidable. Hence, a crucial issue is whether it becomes decidable for known
subclasses of existential rules. In this work, we consider linear existential rules, a simple yet
important subclass of existential rules that generalizes inclusion dependencies. We show the
decidability of the all instance chase termination problem on linear rules for three main chase
variants, namely semi-oblivious, restricted and core chase. To obtain these results, we introduce
a novel approach based on so-called derivation trees and a single notion of forbidden pattern. Besides
the theoretical interest of a unified approach and new proofs, we provide the first positive decidability
results concerning the termination of the restricted chase, proving that chase termination on
linear existential rules is decidable for both versions of the problem: Does every fair chase sequence
terminate? Does some fair chase sequence terminate?
