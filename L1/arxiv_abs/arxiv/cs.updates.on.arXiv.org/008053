A natural way to improve the detection of objects is to consider the contextual constraints imposed
by the detection of additional objects in a given scene. In this work, we exploit the spatial relations
between objects in order to improve detection capacity, as well as analyze various properties of
the contextual object detection problem. To precisely calculate context-based probabilities
of objects, we developed a model that examines the interactions between objects in an exact probabilistic
setting, in contrast to previous methods that typically utilize approximations based on pairwise
interactions. Such a scheme is facilitated by the realistic assumption that the existence of an
object in any given location is influenced by only few informative locations in space. Based on this
assumption, we suggest a method for identifying these relevant locations and integrating them
into a mostly exact calculation of probability based on their raw detector responses. This scheme
is shown to improve detection results and provides unique insights about the process of contextual
inference for object detection. We show that it is generally difficult to learn that a particular
object reduces the probability of another, and that in cases when the context and detector strongly
disagree this learning becomes virtually impossible for the purposes of improving the results
of an object detector. Finally, we demonstrate improved detection results through use of our approach
as applied to the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.
