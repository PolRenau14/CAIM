Neural networks are capable of learning rich, nonlinear feature representations shown to be beneficial
in many predictive tasks. In this work, we use such models to explore different geographical feature
representations in the context of predicting colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in
the state of Iowa, spanning the years 1989 to 2013. Specifically, we compare model performance using
"area between the curves" (ABC) to assess (a) whether survival curves can be reasonably predicted
for colorectal cancer patients in the state of Iowa, (b) whether geographical features improve
predictive performance, (c) whether a simple binary representation, or a richer, spectral analysis-elicited
representation perform better, and (d) whether spectral analysis-based representations can
be improved upon by leveraging geographically-descriptive features. In exploring (d), we devise
a similarity-based spectral analysis procedure, which allows for the combination of geographically
relational and geographically descriptive features. Our findings suggest that survival curves
can be reasonably estimated on average, with predictive performance deviating at the five-year
survival mark among all models. We also find that geographical features improve predictive performance,
and that better performance is obtained using richer, spectral analysis-elicited features. Furthermore,
we find that similarity-based spectral analysis-elicited representations improve upon the original
spectral analysis results by approximately 40%.
