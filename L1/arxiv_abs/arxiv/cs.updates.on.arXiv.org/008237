Time series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or
characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series
and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different
subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series
objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based
on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is
applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length
segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients
of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first
hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments
for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional
space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage,
all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically
adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The
results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared
against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very
promising.
