Lagrangian systems represent a wide range of robotic systems, including manipulators, wheeled
and legged robots, and quadrotors. Inverse dynamics control and feedforward linearization techniques
are typically used to convert the complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled
double integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to calculate the commanded
acceleration for the linearized system. However, these methods typically depend on having a very
accurate system model, which is often not available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed
in the literature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not provide
safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control system. In this paper, we
provide a novel, learning-based control approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures
both stability of the closed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate
the error between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the system, and then
use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an upper bound on the uncertainty of the
linearized model. This uncertainty bound is then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure
stability of the overall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball with
a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our approach
via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator and experimentally on a 6 DOF
industrial manipulator.
