In-memory computing is a promising approach to addressing the processor-memory data transfer
bottleneck in computing systems. We propose Spin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM),
a design for in-memory computing with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). The unique
properties of spintronic memory allow multiple wordlines within an array to be simultaneously
enabled, opening up the possibility of directly sensing functions of the values stored in multiple
rows using a single access. We propose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage
this principle to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We address the challenge
of reliable in-memory computing under process variations by extending ECC schemes to detect and
correct errors that occur during CiM operations. We also address the question of how STT-CiM should
be integrated within a general-purpose computing system. To this end, we propose architectural
enhancements to processor instruction sets and on-chip buses that enable STT-CiM to be utilized
as a scratchpad memory. Finally, we present data mapping techniques to increase the effectiveness
of STT-CiM. We evaluate STT-CiM using a device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate
cycle-accurate models of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus (Nios II and Avalon
from Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM provides system-level performance
improvements of 3.93x on average (upto 10.4x), and concurrently reduces memory system energy by
3.83x on average (upto 12.4x).
