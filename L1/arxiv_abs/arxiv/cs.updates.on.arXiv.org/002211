Data acquisition from a multi-hop large-scale outdoor wireless sensor network (WSN) deployment
for environmental monitoring is full of challenges. This is because the severe resource constraints
on small battery-operated motes (e.g., bandwidth, memory, power, and computing capacity), the
big data acquisition volume from the large-scale WSN,and the highly dynamic wireless link conditions
in an outdoor communication environment. We present a novel compressed sensing approach which
can recover the sensing data at the sink with high fidelity when very few data packets are collected,
leading to a significant reduction of the net-work transmissions and thus an extension of the WSN
lifetime. Interplaying with the dynamic WSN routing topology, the proposed approach is efficient
and simple to implement on the resource-constrained motes without a mote's storing of any part of
the random projection matrix, as opposed to other existing compressed sensing based schemes. We
propose a systematic method via machine learning to find a suitable representation basis, for any
given WSN deployment and data field, which is both sparse and incoherent with the random projection
matrix in the compressed sensing for data acquisition. We validate our approach and evaluate its
performance using a real-world multi-hop WSN testbed deployment in situ. The results demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms existing compressed sensing approaches by reducing
data recovery errors by an order of magnitude for the entire WSN observation field, while drastically
reducing wireless communication costs at the same time.
