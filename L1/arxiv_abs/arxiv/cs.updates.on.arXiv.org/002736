Based on our observation that there exists a dramatic drop for the singular values of the fully connected
layers or a single feature map of the convolutional layer, and that the dimension of the concatenated
feature vector almost equals the summation of the dimension on each feature map, we propose a singular
value decomposition (SVD) based approach to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds for a typical
convolutional neural network VGG19. We choose three categories from the ImageNet, namely Persian
Cat, Container Ship and Volcano, and determine the local dimension of the deep manifolds of the deep
layers through the tangent space of a target image. Through several augmentation methods, we found
that the Gaussian noise method is closer to the intrinsic dimension, as by adding random noise to
an image we are moving in an arbitrary dimension, and when the rank of the feature matrix of the augmented
images does not increase we are very close to the local dimension of the manifold. We also estimate
the dimension of the deep manifold based on the tangent space for each of the maxpooling layers. Our
results show that the dimensions of different categories are close to each other and decline quickly
along the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Furthermore, we show that the dimensions
decline quickly inside the Conv5 layer. Our work provides new insights for the intrinsic structure
of deep neural networks and helps unveiling the inner organization of the black box of deep neural
networks.
