Many randomized algorithms can be derandomized efficiently using either the method of conditional
expectations or probability spaces with low (almost-) independence. A series of papers, beginning
with Luby (1988) and continuing with Berger & Rompel (1991) and Chari et al. (1994), showed that these
techniques can be combined to give deterministic parallel algorithms for combinatorial optimization
problems involving sums of $w$-juntas. We improve these algorithms through derandomized variable
partitioning and a new code construction for fooling Fourier characters over $GF(2)$. This reduces
the processor complexity to essentially independent of $w$ while the running time is reduced from
exponential in $w$ to linear in $w$. As a key subroutine, we give a new algorithm to generate a probability
space which can fool a given set of neighborhoods, each of size at most $w$. Schulman (1992) gave an
NC algorithm to do so for $w \leq O(\log n)$. Our new algorithm is NC1, with essentially optimal time
and processor complexity, when $w = O(\log n)$; it remains NC up to $w = \text{polylog}(n)$. This
answers an open problem of Schulman. One major application of these algorithms is an NC algorithm
for the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Previous NC algorithms, including the seminal algorithm of Moser
\& Tardos (2010) and the work of Chandrasekaran et. al (2013), required that (essentially) the bad-events
could span only $O(\log n)$ variables; we relax this to $\text{polylog}(n)$ variables. We use this
for an $\text{NC}^2$ algorithm for defective vertex coloring, which works for arbitrary degree
graphs.
