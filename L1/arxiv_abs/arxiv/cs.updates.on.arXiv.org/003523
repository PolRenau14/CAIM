Simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) is characterised by the ambiguous role of
multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of multi-user interference on RF energy
harvesting is obtained at the price of a reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs
between the achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor environments,
this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to blockage objects like walls. Hence,
a couple of fundamental questions arise. How much must the network elements be densified to counteract
the blockage attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy trade-off?
In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled
network in the attempt to shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined
with the help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred to as power heads)
are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are generated through a Manhattan Poisson
Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference
is studied to obtain the Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information
rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.
Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function of the frequency of walls to emphasise
the cross-dependences between the deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.
