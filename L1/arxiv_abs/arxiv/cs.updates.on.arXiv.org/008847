Among formal methods, the deductive verification approach allows establishing the strongest
possible formal guarantees on critical software. The downside is the cost in terms of human effort
required to design adequate formal specifications and to successfully discharge the required
proof obligations. To popularize deductive verification in an industrial software development
environment, it is essential to provide means to progressively transition from simple and automated
approaches to deductive verification. The SPARK environment, for development of critical software
written in Ada, goes towards this goal by providing automated tools for formally proving that some
code fulfills the requirements expressed in Ada contracts. In a program verifier that makes use
of automatic provers to discharge the proof obligations, a need for some additional user interaction
with proof tasks shows up: either to help analyzing the reason of a proof failure or, ultimately,
to discharge the verification conditions that are out-of-reach of state-of-the-art automatic
provers. Adding interactive proof features in SPARK appears to be complicated by the fact that the
proof toolchain makes use of the independent, intermediate verification tool Why3, which is generic
enough to accept multiple front-ends for different input languages. This paper reports on our approach
to extend Why3 with interactive proof features and also with a generic client-server infrastructure
allowing integration of proof interaction into an external, front-end graphical user interface
such as the one of SPARK.
