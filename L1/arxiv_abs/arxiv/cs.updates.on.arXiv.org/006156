Modern data introduces new challenges to classic signal processing approaches, leading to a growing
interest in the field of graph signal processing. A powerful and well established model for real
world signals in various domains is sparse representation over a dictionary, combined with the
ability to train the dictionary from signal examples. This model has been successfully applied
to graph signals as well by integrating the underlying graph topology into the learned dictionary.
Nonetheless, dictionary learning methods for graph signals are typically restricted to small
dimensions due to the computational constraints that the dictionary learning problem entails,
and due to the direct use of the graph Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we propose a dictionary learning
algorithm that applies to a broader class of graph signals, and is capable of handling much higher
dimensional data. We incorporate the underlying graph topology both implicitly, by forcing the
learned dictionary atoms to be sparse combinations of graph-wavelet functions, and explicitly,
by adding direct graph constraints to promote smoothness in both the feature and manifold domains.
The resulting atoms are thus adapted to the data of interest while adhering to the underlying graph
structure and possessing a desired multi-scale property. Experimental results on several datasets,
representing both synthetic and real network data of different nature, demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm for graph signal processing even in high dimensions.
