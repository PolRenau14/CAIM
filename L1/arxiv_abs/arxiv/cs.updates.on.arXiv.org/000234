The management of uncertainty in expert systems has usually been left to ad hoc representations
and rules of combinations lacking either a sound theory or clear semantics. The objective of this
paper is to establish a theoretical basis for defining the syntax and semantics of a small subset
of calculi of uncertainty operating on a given term set of linguistic statements of likelihood.
Each calculus is defined by specifying a negation, a conjunction and a disjunction operator. Families
of Triangular norms and conorms constitute the most general representations of conjunction and
disjunction operators. These families provide us with a formalism for defining an infinite number
of different calculi of uncertainty. The term set will define the uncertainty granularity, i.e.
the finest level of distinction among different quantifications of uncertainty. This granularity
will limit the ability to differentiate between two similar operators. Therefore, only a small
finite subset of the infinite number of calculi will produce notably different results. This result
is illustrated by two experiments where nine and eleven different calculi of uncertainty are used
with three term sets containing five, nine, and thirteen elements, respectively. Finally, the
use of context dependent rule set is proposed to select the most appropriate calculus for any given
situation. Such a rule set will be relatively small since it must only describe the selection policies
for a small number of calculi (resulting from the analyzed trade-off between complexity and precision).
