State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms -- especially the collaborative filtering (CF)
based approaches with shallow or deep models -- usually work with various unstructured information
sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit
feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they
have been largely neglected recently due to the availability of vast amount of data, and the learning
power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in
personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered
for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users'
historical behaviors. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to
integrated large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative
filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements on knowledge base embedding sheds
light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving
the structure of their relationship with external knowledge. In this work, we propose to reason
over knowledge base embeddings for personalized recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge
base representation learning approach to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation. Experimental
results on real-world dataset verified the superior performance of our approach compared with
state-of-the-art baselines.
