Sudoku is a widely popular $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete combinatorial puzzle whose prospects for
studying human computation have recently received attention, but the algorithmic hardness of
Sudoku solving is yet largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the statistical mechanical properties
of random Sudoku grids, showing that puzzles of varying sizes attain a hardness peak associated
with a critical behavior in the constrainedness of random instances. In doing so, we provide the
first description of a Sudoku \emph{freezing} transition, showing that the fraction of backbone
variables undergoes a phase transition as the density of pre-filled cells is calibrated. We also
uncover a variety of critical phenomena in the applicability of Sudoku elimination strategies,
providing explanations as to why puzzles become boring outside the typical range of clue densities
adopted by Sudoku publishers. We further show that the constrainedness of Sudoku puzzles can be
understood in terms of the informational (Shannon) entropy of their solutions, which only increases
up to the critical point where variables become frozen. Our findings shed light on the nature of the
$k$-coloring transition when the graph topology is fixed, and are an invitation to the study of phase
transition phenomena in problems defined over \emph{alldifferent} constraints. They also suggest
advantages to studying the statistical mechanics of popular $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard puzzles, which
can both aid the design of hard instances and help understand the difficulty of human problem solving.
