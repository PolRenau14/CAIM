We consider colorful bin packing games in which selfish players control a set of items which are to
be packed into a minimum number of unit capacity bins. Each item has one of $m\geq 2$ colors and cannot
be packed next to an item of the same color. All bins have the same unitary cost which is shared among
the items it contains, so that players are interested in selecting a bin of minimum shared cost. We
adopt two standard cost sharing functions: the egalitarian cost function which equally shares
the cost of a bin among the items it contains, and the proportional cost function which shares the
cost of a bin among the items it contains proportionally to their sizes. Although, under both cost
functions, colorful bin packing games do not converge in general to a (pure) Nash equilibrium, we
show that Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist and we design an algorithm for computing a Nash
equilibrium whose running time is polynomial under the egalitarian cost function and pseudo-polynomial
for a constant number of colors under the proportional one. We also provide a complete characterization
of the efficiency of Nash equilibria under both cost functions for general games, by showing that
the prices of anarchy and stability are unbounded when $m\geq 3$ while they are equal to 3 for black
and white games, where $m=2$. We finally focus on games with uniform sizes (i.e., all items have the
same size) for which the two cost functions coincide. We show again a tight characterization of the
efficiency of Nash equilibria and design an algorithm which returns Nash equilibria with best achievable
performance.
