In this paper, we study the delay-constrained input-queued switch where each packet has a deadline
and it will expire if it is not delivered before its deadline. Such new scenario is motivated by the
proliferation of real-time applications in multimedia communication systems, tactile Internet,
networked controlled systems, and cyber-physical systems. The delay-constrained input-queued
switch is completely different from the well-understood delay-unconstrained one and thus poses
new challenges. We focus on three fundamental problems centering around the performance metric
of timely throughput: (i) how to characterize the capacity region? (ii) how to design a feasibility/throughput-optimal
scheduling policy? and (iii) how to design a network-utility-maximization scheduling policy?
We use three different approaches to solve these three fundamental problems. The first approach
is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory, which can solve all three problems. However, it
suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second approach breaks the curse of dimensionality
by exploiting the combinatorial features of the problem. It gives a new capacity region characterization
with only a polynomial number of linear constraints. The third approach is based on the framework
of Lyapunov optimization, where we design a polynomial-time maximum-weight T-disjoint-matching
scheduling policy which is proved to be feasibility/throughput-optimal. Our three approaches
apply to the frame-synchronized traffic pattern but our MDP-based approach can be extended to more
general traffic patterns.
