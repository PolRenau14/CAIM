This paper proposes a two-stage scoring approach to help lenders decide their fund allocations
in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market. The existing scoring approaches focus on only either
probability of default (PD) prediction, known as credit scoring, or profitability prediction,
known as profit scoring, to identify the best loans for investment. Credit scoring fails to deliver
the main need of lenders on how much profit they may obtain through their investment. On the other
hand, profit scoring can satisfy that need by predicting the investment profitability. However,
profit scoring completely ignores the class imbalance problem where most of the past loans are non-default.
Consequently, ignorance of the class imbalance problem significantly affects the accuracy of
profitability prediction. Our proposed two-stage scoring approach is an integration of credit
scoring and profit scoring to address the above challenges. More specifically, stage 1 is designed
as credit scoring to identify non-default loans while the imbalanced nature of loan status is considered
in PD prediction. The loans identified as non-default are then moved to stage 2 for prediction of
profitability, measured by internal rate of return. Wide and deep learning is used to build the predictive
models in both stages to achieve both memorization and generalization. Extensive numerical studies
are conducted based on real-world data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
numerical studies indicate our two-stage scoring approach outperforms the existing credit scoring
and profit scoring approaches.
