Technology has positive impacts on many aspects of our social life. Designing a 24hour globally
connected architecture enables ease of access to a variety of resources and services. Furthermore,
technology like Internet has been a fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One of such disruptive
innovation is blockchain -- a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is presented
as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging technologies/services. With its immutability
property and decentralised architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation
factor to the current parity between consumers and large corporations/governments. One of such
potential applications of the blockchain is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme
would be to provide a decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open,
fair and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose potentially a new e-voting protocol
that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The protocol has been designed with adhering
to the fundamental e-voting properties in mind as well as offering a degree of decentralisation
and allowing for the voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period).
The paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from practical point
view in both development/deployment and usage contexts. Concluding the paper with a potential
roadmap for blockchain technology to be able to support complex applications.
