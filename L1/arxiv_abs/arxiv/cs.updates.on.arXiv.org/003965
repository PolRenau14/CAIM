Context: Technical debt management is challenging for software engineers due to poor tool support
and a lack of knowledge on how to prioritize technical debt repayment and prevention activities.
Furthermore, when there is a large backlog of debt, developers often lack the motivation to address
it. Objective: In this paper, we describe a design study to investigate how gamification can support
Technical Debt Management in a large legacy software system of an industrial company. Our study
leads to a novel tool (named Themis) that combines technical debt support, version control, and
gamification features. In addition to gamification features, Themis provides suggestions for
developers on where to focus their effort, and visualizations for managers to track technical debt
activities. Method: We describe how Themis was refined and validated in an iterative deployment
with the company, finally conducting a qualitative study to investigate how the features of Themis
affect technical debt management behavior. We consider the impact on both developers and managers.
Results: Our results show that it achieves increased developer motivation, and supports managers
in monitoring and influencing developer behaviors. We show how our findings may be transferable
to other contexts by proposing guidelines on how to apply gamification. Conclusions: With this
case, gamification appears as a promising solution to help technical debt management, although
it needs to be carefully designed and implemented to avoid its possible negative effects.
