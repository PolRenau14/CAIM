Introduction: An approach to building a hybrid simulation of patient flow is introduced with a combination
of data-driven methods for automation of model identification. The approach is described with
a conceptual framework and basic methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation
of the proposed approach for simulation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed and used
within an experimental study. Methods: Combination of data, text, and process mining techniques
and machine learning approaches for analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event
simulation (DES) and queueing theory for simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed
analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enable identification of several classes of clinical pathways
(CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic simulation of the patient flow. The developed
solution was implemented using Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others). Results: The proposed
approach enables more realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a group of related
departments. Experimental study shows that the improved simulation of patient length of stay for
ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in Federal Almazov North-west Medical Research Centre in Saint
Petersburg, Russia. Conclusion: The proposed approach, methods, and solutions provide a conceptual,
methodological, and programming framework for implementation of simulation of complex and diverse
scenarios within a flow of patients for different purposes: decision making, training, management
optimization, and others.
