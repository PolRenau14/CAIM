The ever-increasing growth in the number of connected smart devices and various Internet of Things
(IoT) verticals is leading to a crucial challenge of handling massive amount of raw data generated
from distributed IoT systems and providing real-time feedback to the end-users. Although existing
cloud-computing paradigm has an enormous amount of virtual computing power and storage capacity,
it is not suitable for latency-sensitive applications and distributed systems due to the involved
latency and its centralized mode of operation. To this end, edge/fog computing has recently emerged
as the next generation of computing systems for extending cloud-computing functions to the edges
of the network. Despite several benefits of edge computing such as geo-distribution, mobility
support and location awareness, various communication and computing related challenges need
to be addressed in realizing edge computing technologies for future IoT systems. In this regard,
this paper provides a holistic view on the current issues and effective solutions by classifying
the emerging technologies in regard to the joint coordination of radio and computing resources,
system optimization and intelligent resource management. Furthermore, an optimization framework
for edge-IoT systems is proposed to enhance various performance metrics such as throughput, delay,
resource utilization and energy consumption. Finally, a Machine Learning (ML) based case study
is presented along with some numerical results to illustrate the significance of edge computing.
