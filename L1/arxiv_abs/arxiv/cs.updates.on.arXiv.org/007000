Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs) is a widely used failure modeling technique that allows capturing the
dynamic failure characteristics of systems in a very effective manner. Simulation and model checking
have been traditionally used for the probabilistic analysis of DFTs. Simulation is usually based
on sampling and thus its results are not guaranteed to be complete, whereas model checking employs
computer arithmetic and numerical algorithms to compute the exact values of probabilities, which
contain many round-off errors. Leveraging upon the expressive and sound nature of higher-order-logic
(HOL) theorem proving, we propose, in this work, a formalization of DFT gates and their probabilistic
behavior as well as some of their simplification properties in HOL. This formalization would allow
us to conduct the probabilistic analysis of DFTs by verifying generic mathematical expressions
about their behavior in HOL. In particular, we formalize the AND, OR, Priority-AND, Functional
DEPendency, Hot SPare, Cold SPare and the Warm SPare gates and also verify their corresponding probabilistic
expressions in HOL. Moreover, we formally verify an important property, Pr(X<Y), using the Lebesgue
integral as this relationship allows us to reason about the probabilistic properties of Priority-AND
gate and the Before operator. We also formalize the notion of conditional densities in order to formally
verify the probabilistic expressions of the Cold SPare and the Warm SPare gates. For illustrating
the usefulness of our formalization, we use it to formally analyze the DFT of a Cardiac Assist System.
