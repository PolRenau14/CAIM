In this paper, we analyze and optimize the energy efficiency of downlink cellular networks. With
the aid of tools from stochastic geometry, we introduce a new closed-form analytical expression
of the potential spectral efficiency (bit/sec/m$^2$). In the interference-limited regime for
data transmission, unlike currently available mathematical frameworks, the proposed analytical
formulation depends on the transmit power and deployment density of the base stations. This is obtained
by generalizing the definition of coverage probability and by accounting for the sensitivity of
the receiver not only during the decoding of information data, but during the cell association phase
as well. Based on the new formulation of the potential spectral efficiency, the energy efficiency
(bit/Joule) is given in a tractable closed-form formula. An optimization problem is formulated
and is comprehensively studied. It is mathematically proved, in particular, that the energy efficiency
is a unimodal and strictly pseudo-concave function in the transmit power, given the density of the
base stations, and in the density of the base stations, given the transmit power. Under these assumptions,
therefore, a unique transmit power and density of the base stations exist, which maximize the energy
efficiency. Numerical results are illustrated in order to confirm the obtained findings and to
prove the usefulness of the proposed framework for optimizing the network planning and deployment
of cellular networks from the energy efficiency standpoint.
