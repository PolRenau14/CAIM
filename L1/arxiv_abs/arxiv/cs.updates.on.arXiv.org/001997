Given a set $U$ of alternatives, a choice (correspondence) on $U$ is a contractive map $c$ defined
on a family $\Omega$ of nonempty subsets of $U$. Semantically, a choice $c$ associates to each menu
$A \in \Omega$ a nonempty subset $c(A) \subseteq A$ comprising all elements of $A$ that are deemed
selectable by an agent. A choice on $U$ is total if its domain is the powerset of $U$ minus the empty
set, and partial otherwise. According to the theory of revealed preferences, a choice is rationalizable
if it can be retrieved from a binary relation on $U$ by taking all maximal elements of each menu. It
is well-known that rationalizable choices are characterized by the satisfaction of suitable axioms
of consistency, which codify logical rules of selection within menus. For instance, WARP (Weak
Axiom of Revealed Preference) characterizes choices rationalizable by a transitive relation.
Here we study the satisfiability problem for unquantified formulae of an elementary fragment of
set theory involving a choice function symbol $\mathtt{c}$, the Boolean set operators and the singleton,
the equality and inclusion predicates, and the propositional connectives. In particular, we consider
the cases in which the interpretation of $\mathtt{c}$ satisfies any combination of two specific
axioms of consistency, whose conjunction is equivalent to WARP. In two cases we prove that the related
satisfiability problem is NP-complete, whereas in the remaining cases we obtain NP-completeness
under the additional assumption that the number of choice terms is constant.
