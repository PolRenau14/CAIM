Dynamic diversification---finding a set of data points with maximum diversity from a time-dependent
sample pool---is an important task in recommender systems, web search, database search, and notification
services, to avoid showing users duplicate or very similar items. The incremental cover tree (ICT)
with high computational efficiency and flexibility has been applied to this task, and shown good
performance. Specifically, it was empirically observed that ICT typically provides a set with
its diversity only marginally ($\sim 1/ 1.2$ times) worse than the greedy max-min (GMM) algorithm,
the state-of-the-art method for static diversification with its performance bound optimal for
any polynomial time algorithm. Nevertheless, the known performance bound for ICT is 4 times worse
than this optimal bound. With this paper, we aim to fill this very gap between theory and empirical
observations. For achieving this, we first analyze variants of ICT methods, and derive tighter
performance bounds. We then investigate the gap between the obtained bound and empirical observations
by using specially designed artificial data for which the optimal diversity is known. Finally,
we analyze the tightness of the bound, and show that the bound cannot be further improved, i.e., this
paper provides the tightest possible bound for ICT methods. In addition, we demonstrate a new use
of dynamic diversification for generative image samplers, where prototypes are incrementally
collected from a stream of artificial images generated by an image sampler.
