Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases have been considered one of the dominant approaches to combining open
world ontology languages with closed world rule-based languages. Currently, the only known inference
methods are based on the approach of guess-and-verify, while most modern SAT/ASP solvers are built
under the DPLL architecture. The central impediment here is that it is not clear what constitutes
a constraint propagator, a key component employed in any DPLL-based solver. In this paper, we address
this problem by formulating the notion of unfounded sets for nondisjunctive hybrid MKNF knowledge
bases, based on which we propose and study two new well-founded operators. We show that by employing
a well-founded operator as a constraint propagator, a sound and complete DPLL search engine can
be readily defined. We compare our approach with the operator based on the alternating fixpoint
construction by Knorr et al [2011] and show that, when applied to arbitrary partial partitions,
the new well-founded operators not only propagate more truth values but also circumvent the non-converging
behavior of the latter. In addition, we study the possibility of simplifying a given hybrid MKNF
knowledge base by employing a well-founded operator, and show that, out of the two operators proposed
in this paper, the weaker one can be applied for this purpose and the stronger one cannot. These observations
are useful in implementing a grounder for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which can be applied before
the computation of MKNF models. The paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.
