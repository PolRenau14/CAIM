Eyal and Sirer's selfish mining strategy has demonstrated that Bitcoin system is not secure even
if 50% of total mining power is held by altruistic miners. Since then, researchers have been investigating
either to improve the efficiency of selfish mining, or how to defend against it, typically in a single
selfish miner setting. Yet there is no research on a selfish mining strategies concurrently used
by multiple miners in the system. The effectiveness of such selfish mining strategies and their
required mining power under such multiple selfish miners setting remains unknown. In this paper,
a preliminary investigation and our findings of selfish mining strategy used by multiple miners
are reported. In addition, the conventional model of Bitcoin system is slightly redesigned to tackle
its shortcoming: namely, a concurrency of individual mining processes. Although a theoretical
analysis of selfish mining strategy under this setting is yet to be established, the current findings
based on simulations is promising and of great interest. In particular, our work shows that a lower
bound of power threshold required for selfish mining strategy decreases in proportion to a number
of selfish miners. Moreover, there exist Nash equilibria where all selfish miners in the system
do not change to an honest mining strategy and simultaneously earn their unfair amount of mining
reward given that they equally possess sufficiently large mining power. Lastly, our new model yields
a power threshold for mounting selfish mining strategy slightly greater than one from the conventional
model.
