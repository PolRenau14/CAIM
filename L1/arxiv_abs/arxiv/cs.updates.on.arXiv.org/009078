Small cell networks promise good quality of service (QoS) even for cell edge users, however pose
challenges to cater to the high-speed users. The major difficulty being that of frequent handovers
and the corresponding handover losses, which significantly depend upon the speed of the user. It
was shown previously that the optimal cell size increases with speed. Thus, in scenarios with diverse
users (speeds spanning over large ranges), it would be inefficient to serve all users using common
cell radius and it is practically infeasible to design different cell sizes for different speeds.
Alternatively, we propose to allocate power to a user based on its speed, e.g., higher power virtually
increases the cell size. We solve well known Hamiltonian Jacobi equations under certain assumptions
to obtain a power law, optimal for load factor and busy probability, for any given average power constraint
and cell size. The optimal power control turns out to be linear in speed. We build a system level simulator
for small cell network, using elaborate Monte-Carlo simulations, and show that the performance
of the system improves significantly with linear power law. The power law is tested even for the cases,
for which the system does not satisfy the assumptions required by the theory. For example, the linear
power law has significant improvement in comparison with the 'equal power' system, even in presence
of time varying and random interference. We observe good improvement in almost all cases with improvements
up to 89\% for certain configurations.
