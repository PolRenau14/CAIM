Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a truly-declarative programming paradigm proposed in the area
of non-monotonic reasoning and logic programming, that has been recently employed in many applications.
The development of efficient ASP systems is, thus, crucial. Having in mind the task of improving
the solving methods for ASP, there are two usual ways to reach this goal: $(i)$ extending state-of-the-art
techniques and ASP solvers, or $(ii)$ designing a new ASP solver from scratch. An alternative to
these trends is to build on top of state-of-the-art solvers, and to apply machine learning techniques
for choosing automatically the "best" available solver on a per-instance basis. In this paper we
pursue this latter direction. We first define a set of cheap-to-compute syntactic features that
characterize several aspects of ASP programs. Then, we apply classification methods that, given
the features of the instances in a {\sl training} set and the solvers' performance on these instances,
inductively learn algorithm selection strategies to be applied to a {\sl test} set. We report the
results of a number of experiments considering solvers and different training and test sets of instances
taken from the ones submitted to the "System Track" of the 3rd ASP Competition. Our analysis shows
that, by applying machine learning techniques to ASP solving, it is possible to obtain very robust
performance: our approach can solve more instances compared with any solver that entered the 3rd
ASP Competition. (To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).)
