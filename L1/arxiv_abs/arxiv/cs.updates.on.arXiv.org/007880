Many algorithms in workflow scheduling and resource provisioning rely on the performance estimation
of tasks to produce a scheduling plan. A profiler that is capable of modeling the execution of tasks
and predicting their runtime accurately, therefore, becomes an essential part of any Workflow
Management System (WMS). With the emergence of multi-tenant Workflow as a Service (WaaS) platforms
that use clouds for deploying scientific workflows, task runtime prediction becomes more challenging
because it requires the processing of a significant amount of data in a near real-time scenario while
dealing with the performance variability of cloud resources. Hence, relying on methods such as
profiling tasks' execution data using basic statistical description (e.g., mean, standard deviation)
or batch offline regression techniques to estimate the runtime may not be suitable for such environments.
In this paper, we propose an online incremental learning approach to predict the runtime of tasks
in scientific workflows in clouds. To improve the performance of the predictions, we harness fine-grained
resources monitoring data in the form of time-series records of CPU utilization, memory usage,
and I/O activities that are reflecting the unique characteristics of a task's execution. We compare
our solution to a state-of-the-art approach that exploits the resources monitoring data based
on regression machine learning technique. From our experiments, the proposed strategy improves
the performance, in terms of the error, up to 29.89%, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.
