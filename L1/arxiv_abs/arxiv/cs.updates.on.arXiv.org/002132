This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 24th International Workshop on Expressiveness
in Concurrency and the 14th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2017) which
was held on 04 September 2017 in Berlin, Germany, as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2017, the 28th
International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together
researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions,
particularly in the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison
between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented
programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive
power. The EXPRESS workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus
has become broadly construed. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future investigation, in the
field of structural operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the SOS workshop series
is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming language communities working
on the theory and practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an annual
combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical models of computation and
the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts.
