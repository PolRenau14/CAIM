Cyberbullying is a disturbing online misbehaviour with troubling consequences. It appears in
different forms, and in most of the social networks, it is in textual format. Automatic detection
of such incidents requires intelligent systems. Most of the existing studies have approached this
problem with conventional machine learning models and the majority of the developed models in these
studies are adaptable to a single social network at a time. In recent studies, deep learning based
models have found their way in the detection of cyberbullying incidents, claiming that they can
overcome the limitations of the conventional models, and improve the detection performance. In
this paper, we investigate the findings of a recent literature in this regard. We successfully reproduced
the findings of this literature and validated their findings using the same datasets, namely Wikipedia,
Twitter, and Formspring, used by the authors. Then we expanded our work by applying the developed
methods on a new YouTube dataset (~54k posts by ~4k users) and investigated the performance of the
models in new social media platforms. We also transferred and evaluated the performance of the models
trained on one platform to another platform. Our findings show that the deep learning based models
outperform the machine learning models previously applied to the same YouTube dataset. We believe
that the deep learning based models can also benefit from integrating other sources of information
and looking into the impact of profile information of the users in social networks.
