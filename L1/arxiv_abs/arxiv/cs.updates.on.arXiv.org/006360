Cloud services have recently exploded with the advent of powerful cloud-computing platforms such
as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Today, most cloud services are accessed through REST
APIs, and Swagger is arguably the most popular interface-description language for REST APIs. A
Swagger specification describes how to access a cloud service through its REST API (e.g., what requests
the service can handle and what responses may be expected). This paper introduces REST-ler, the
first automatic intelligent REST API security-testing tool. REST-ler analyzes a Swagger specification
and generates tests that exercise the corresponding cloud service through its REST API. Each test
is defined as a sequence of requests and responses. REST-ler generates tests intelligently by (1)
inferring dependencies among request types declared in the Swagger specification (e.g., inferring
that "a request B should not be executed before a request A" because B takes as an input argument a resource-id
x returned by A) and by (2) analyzing dynamic feedback from responses observed during prior test
executions in order to generate new tests (e.g., learning that "a request C after a request sequence
A;B is refused by the service" and therefore avoiding this combination in the future). We show that
these two techniques are necessary to thoroughly exercise a service under test while pruning the
large search space of possible request sequences. We also discuss the application of REST-ler to
test GitLab, a large popular open-source self-hosted Git service, and the new bugs that were found.
