Follower count is a factor that quantifies the popularity of celebrities. It is a reflection of their
power, prestige and overall social reach. In this paper we investigate whether the social connectivity
or the language choice is more correlated to the future follower count of a celebrity. We collect
data about tweets, retweets and mentions of 471 Indian celebrities with verified Twitter accounts.
We build two novel networks to approximate social connectivity of the celebrities. We study various
structural properties of these two networks and observe their correlations with future follower
counts. In parallel, we analyze the linguistic structure of the tweets (LIWC features, syntax and
sentiment features and style and readability features) and observe the correlations of each of
these with the future follower count of a celebrity. As a final step we use there features to classify
a celebrity in a specific bucket of future follower count (HIGH, MID or LOW). We observe that the network
features alone achieve an accuracy of 0.52 while the linguistic features alone achieve an accuracy
of 0.69 grossly outperforming the network features. The network and linguistic features in conjunction
produce an accuracy of 0.76. We also discuss some final insights that we obtain from further data
analysis celebrities with larger follower counts post tweets that have (i) more words from friend
and family LIWC categories, (ii) more positive sentiment laden words, (iii) have better language
constructs and are (iv) more readable.
