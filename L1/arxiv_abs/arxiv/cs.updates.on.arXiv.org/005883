A finite dynamical system (FDS) is a system of multivariate functions over a finite alphabet, that
is typically used to model a network of interacting entities. The main feature of a finite dynamical
system is its interaction graph, which indicates which local functions depend on which variables;
the interaction graph is a qualitative representation of the interactions amongst entities on
the network. As such, a major problem is to determine the effect of the interaction graph on the dynamics
of the FDS. In this paper, we are interested in three main properties of an FDS: the number of images
(the so-called rank), the number of periodic points (the so-called periodic rank) and the number
of fixed points. In particular, we investigate the minimum, average, and maximum number of images
(or periodic points, or fixed points) of FDSs with a prescribed interaction graph and a given alphabet
size; thus yielding nine quantities to study. The paper is split into two parts. The first part considers
the minimum rank, for which we derive the first meaningful results known so far. In particular, we
show that the minimum rank decreases with the alphabet size, thus yielding the definition of an absolute
minimum rank. We obtain lower and upper bounds on this absolute minimum rank, and we give classification
results for graphs with very low (or highest) rank. The second part is a comprehensive survey of the
results obtained on the nine quantities described above. We not only give a review of known results,
but we also give a list of relevant open questions.
