Estimation of reliable whole-brain connectivity is a crucial step towards the use of connectivity
information in quantitative approaches to the study of neuropsychiatric disorders. When estimating
brain connectivity a challenge is imposed by the paucity of time samples and the large dimensionality
of the measurements. Bayesian estimation methods for network models offer a number of advantages
in this context but are not commonly employed. Here we compare three different estimation methods
for the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, that has recently gained some popularity for characterizing
whole-brain connectivity. We first show that a Bayesian estimation of model parameters assuming
uniform priors is equivalent to an application of the method of moments. Then, using synthetic data,
we show that the Bayesian estimate scales poorly with number of nodes in the network as compared to
an iterative Lyapunov optimization. In particular when the network size is in the order of that used
for whole-brain studies (about 100 nodes) the Bayesian method needs about eight times more time
samples than Lyapunov method in order to achieve similar estimation accuracy. We also show that
the higher estimation accuracy of Lyapunov method is reflected in a much better classification
of individuals based on the estimated connectivity from a real dataset of BOLD fMRI. Finally we show
that the poor accuracy of Bayesian method is due to numerical errors, when the imaginary part of the
connectivity estimate gets large compared to its real part.
