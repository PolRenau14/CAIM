Deploying sensor nodes randomly most of the time generates initial communication hole even in highly
dense networks. These communication holes cannot be totally eliminated even when the deployment
is done in a structured manner. In either case, the resulting inter-node distances may degrade the
performance of the network. This paper proposes an enhanced deployment algorithm based on Artificial
Bees Colony (ABC). The ABC-based deployment is guaranteed to extend the lifetime by optimizing
the network parameters and constraining the total number of deployed relays. Simulations validate
the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different cases of problem complexity. Results
show that the proposed approach improves the network lifetime considerably when compared to solutions
reported in the literature such as Shortest Path 3-D grid Deployment (SP3D) algorithm. Keywords:
