Diderot is a parallel domain-specific language for analysis and visualization of multidimensional
scientific images, such as those produced by CT and MRI scanners. In particular, it supports algorithms
where tensor fields (i.e., functions from 3D points to tensor values) are used to represent the underlying
physical objects that were scanned by the imaging device. Diderot supports higher-order programming
where tensor fields are first-class values and where differential operators and lifted linear-algebra
operators can be used to express mathematical reasoning directly in the language. While such lifted
field operations are central to the definition and computation of many scientific visualization
algorithms, to date they have required extensive manual derivations and laborious implementation.
The challenge for the Diderot compiler is to effectively translate the high-level mathematical
concepts that are expressible in the surface language to a low-level and efficient implementation
in C. This paper describes our approach to this challenge, which is based around the careful design
of an intermediate representation (IR), called EIN, and a number of compiler transformations that
lower the program from tensor calculus to C while avoiding combinatorial explosion in the size of
the IR. We describe the challenges in compiling a language like Diderot, the design of EIN, and the
transformation used by the compiler. We also present an evaluation of EIN with respect to both compiler
efficiency and quality of generated code.
