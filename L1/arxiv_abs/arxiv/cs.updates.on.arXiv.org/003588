With the ubiquity of mobile touchscreen devices like smartphones, two widely used text entry methods
have emerged: small touch-based keyboards and speech recognition. Although speech recognition
has been available on desktop computers for years, it has continued to improve at a rapid pace, and
it is currently unknown how today's modern speech recognizers compare to state-of-the-art mobile
touch keyboards, which also have improved considerably since their inception. To discover both
methods' "upper-bound performance," we evaluated them in English and Mandarin Chinese on an Apple
iPhone 6 Plus in a laboratory setting. Our experiment was carried out using Baidu's Deep Speech 2,
a deep learning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty (English) or Pinyin (Mandarin)
Apple iOS keyboards. We found that with speech recognition, the English input rate was 2.93 times
faster (153 vs. 52 WPM), and the Mandarin Chinese input rate was 2.87 times faster (123 vs. 43 WPM)
than the keyboard for short message transcription under laboratory conditions for both methods.
Furthermore, although speech made fewer errors during entry (5.30% vs. 11.22% corrected error
rate), it left slightly more errors in the final transcribed text (1.30% vs. 0.79% uncorrected error
rate). Our results show that comparatively, under ideal conditions for both methods, upper-bound
speech recognition performance has greatly improved compared to prior systems, and might see greater
uptake in the future, although further study is required to quantify performance in non-laboratory
settings for both methods.
