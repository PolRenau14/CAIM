Long-lead forecasting for spatio-temporal systems can often entail complex nonlinear dynamics
that are difficult to specify it a priori. Current statistical methodologies for modeling these
processes are often highly parameterized and thus, challenging to implement from a computational
perspective. One potential parsimonious solution to this problem is a method from the dynamical
systems and engineering literature referred to as an echo state network (ESN). ESN models use so-called
{\it reservoir computing} to efficiently compute recurrent neural network (RNN) forecasts. Moreover,
so-called "deep" models have recently been shown to be successful at predicting high-dimensional
complex nonlinear processes, particularly those with multiple spatial and temporal scales of
variability (such as we often find in spatio-temporal environmental data). Here we introduce a
deep ensemble ESN (D-EESN) model. We present two versions of this model for spatio-temporal processes
that both produce forecasts and associated measures of uncertainty. The first approach utilizes
a bootstrap ensemble framework and the second is developed within a hierarchical Bayesian framework
(BD-EESN). This more general hierarchical Bayesian framework naturally accommodates non-Gaussian
data types and multiple levels of uncertainties. The methodology is first applied to a data set simulated
from a novel non-Gaussian multiscale Lorenz-96 dynamical system simulation model and then to a
long-lead United States (U.S.) soil moisture forecasting application.
