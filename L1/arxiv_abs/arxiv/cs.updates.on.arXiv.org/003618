High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) significantly reduces bit-rates over the proceeding H.264
standard but at the expense of extremely high encoding complexity. In HEVC, the quad-tree partition
of coding unit (CU) consumes a large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the bruteforce
search for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning
approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and inter-modes,
which is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network.
First, we establish a large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for HEVC intra-
and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we represent the CU partition
of an entire coding tree unit (CTU) in the form of a hierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we
propose an early-terminated hierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently,
the encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing the brute-force
search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an early-terminated hierarchical LSTM (ETH-LSTM)
is proposed to learn the temporal correlation of the CU partition. Then, we combine ETH-LSTM and
ETH-CNN to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity for inter-mode. Finally, experimental
results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the
HEVC complexity at both intra- and inter-modes.
