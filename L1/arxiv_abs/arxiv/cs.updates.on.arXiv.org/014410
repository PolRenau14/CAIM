The traditional multicopter design method usually requires a long iterative process to find the
optimal design based on given performance requirements. The method is uneconomical and inefficient.
In this paper, a practical method is proposed to automatically calculate the optimal multicopter
design according to the given design requirements including flight time, altitude, payload capacity,
and maneuverability. The proposed method contains two algorithms: an offline algorithm and an
online algorithm. The offline algorithm finds the optimal components (propeller and electronic
speed controller) for each motor to establish its component combination, and subsequently, these
component combinations and their key performance parameters are stored in a combination database.
The online algorithm obtains the multicopter design results that satisfy the given requirements
by searching through the component combinations in the database and calculating the optimal parameters
for the battery and airframe. Subsequently, these requirement-satisfied multicopter design
results are obtained and sorted according to an objective function that contains evaluation indexes
including size, weight, performance, and practicability. The proposed method has the advantages
of high precision and quick calculating speed because parameter calibrations and time-consuming
calculations are completed offline. Experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness
and practicality of the proposed method. Comparisons with the brutal search method and other design
methods demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
