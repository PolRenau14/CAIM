The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned as a global network of connected things enabling ubiquitous
machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. With estimations of billions of sensors and devices
to be connected in the coming years, the IoT has been advocated as having a great potential to impact
the way we live, but also how we work. However, the connectivity aspect in itself only accounts for
the underlying M2M infrastructure. In order to properly support engineering IoT systems and applications,
it is key to orchestrate heterogeneous 'things' in a seamless, adaptive and dynamic manner, such
that the system can exhibit a goal-directed behaviour and take appropriate actions. Yet, this form
of interaction between things needs to take a user-centric approach and by no means elude the users'
requirements. To this end, contextualisation is an important feature of the system, allowing it
to infer user activities and prompt the user with relevant information and interactions even in
the absence of intentional commands. In this work we propose a role-based model for emergent configurations
of connected systems as a means to model, manage, and reason about IoT systems including the user's
interaction with them. We put a special focus on integrating the user perspective in order to guide
the emergent configurations such that systems goals are aligned with the users' intentions. We
discuss related scientific and technical challenges and provide several uses cases outlining
the concept of emergent configurations.
