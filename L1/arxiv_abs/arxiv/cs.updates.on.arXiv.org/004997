Natural plants are exemplars of adaptation through self-organisation and collective decision
making. As such, they provide a rich source of inspiration for adaptive mechanisms in artificial
systems. Plant growth - a structure development mechanism of continuous material accumulation
that expresses encoded morphological features through environmental interactions - has been
extensively explored in-silico. However, ex-silico scalable morphological adaptation through
material accumulation remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel type of biologically
inspired modularity, and an approach to artificial growth that combines the benefits of material
continuity through braiding with a distributed and decentralised plant-inspired Vascular Morphogenesis
Controller (VMC). The controller runs on nodes that are capable of sensing and communicating with
their neighbours. The nodes are embedded within the braided structure, which can be morphologically
adapted based on collective decision making between nodes. Human agents realise the material adaptation
by physically adding to the braided structure according to the suggestion of the embedded controller.
This work offers a novel, tangible and accessible approach to embedding mechanisms of artificial
growth and morphological adaptation within physically embodied systems, offering radically
new functionalities, innovation potentials and approaches to continuous autonomous or steered
design that could find application within fields contributing to the built environment, such as
Architecture.
