The notions of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness have been applied very successfully in algorithmic
graph theory. We study the corresponding notions of directed bounded expansion and nowhere crownfulness
on directed graphs. We show that many of the algorithmic tools that were developed for undirected
bounded expansion classes can, with some care, also be applied in their directed counterparts,
and thereby we highlight a rich algorithmic structure theory of directed bounded expansion classes.
More specifically, we show that the directed Steiner tree problem is fixed-parameter tractable
on any class of directed bounded expansion parameterized by the number $k$ of non-terminals plus
the maximal diameter $s$ of a strongly connected component in the subgraph induced by the terminals.
Our result strongly generalizes a result of Jones et al., who proved that the problem is fixed parameter
tractable on digraphs of bounded degeneracy if the set of terminals is required to be acyclic. We
furthermore prove that for every integer $r\geq 1$, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem can
be approximated up to a factor $O(\log k)$ and the connected distance-$r$ dominating set problem
can be approximated up to a factor $O(k\cdot \log k)$ on any class of directed bounded expansion,
where $k$ denotes the size of an optimal solution. If furthermore, the class is nowhere crownful,
we are able to compute a polynomial kernel for distance-$r$ dominating sets. Polynomial kernels
for this problem were not known to exist on any other existing digraph measure for sparse classes.
