Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as a major global health threat. Having access to any type
of information in social media has been suggested as a potential powerful influence factor to hesitancy.
Recent studies in other fields than vaccination show that access to a wide amount of content through
the Internet without intermediaries resolved into major segregation of the users in polarized
groups. Users select the information adhering to theirs system of beliefs and tend to ignore dissenting
information. In this paper we assess whether there is polarization in Social Media use in the field
of vaccination. We perform a thorough quantitative analysis on Facebook analyzing 2.6M users interacting
with 298.018 posts over a time span of seven years and 5 months. We used community detection algorithms
to automatically detect the emergent communities from the users activity and to quantify the cohesiveness
over time of the communities. Our findings show that content consumption about vaccines is dominated
by the echo-chamber effect and that polarization increased over years. Communities emerge from
the users consumption habits, i.e. the majority of users only consumes information in favor or against
vaccines, not both. The existence of echo-chambers may explain why social-media campaigns providing
accurate information may have limited reach, may be effective only in sub-groups and might even
foment further polarization of opinions. The introduction of dissenting information into a sub-group
is disregarded and can have a backfire effect, further reinforcing the existing opinions within
the sub-group.
