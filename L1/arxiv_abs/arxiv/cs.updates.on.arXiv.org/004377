Language can be described as a network of interacting objects with different qualitative properties
and complexity. These networks include semantic, syntactic, or phonological levels and have been
found to provide a new picture of language complexity and its evolution. A general approach considers
language from an information theory perspective that incorporates a speaker, a hearer, and a noisy
channel. The later is often encoded in a matrix connecting the signals used for communication with
meanings to be found in the real world. Most studies of language evolution deal in a way or another
with such theoretical contraption and explore the outcome of diverse forms of selection on the communication
matrix that somewhat optimizes communication. This framework naturally introduces networks
mediating the communicating agents, but no systematic analysis of the underlying landscape of
possible language graphs has been developed. Here we present a detailed analysis of network properties
on a generic model of a communication code, which reveals a rather complex and heterogeneous morphospace
of language networks. Additionally, we use curated data of English words to locate and evaluate
real languages within this language morphospace. Our findings indicate a surprisingly simple
structure in human language unless particles are introduced in the vocabulary, with the ability
of naming any other concept. These results refine and for the first time complement with empirical
data a lasting theoretical tradition around the framework of \emph{least effort language}.
