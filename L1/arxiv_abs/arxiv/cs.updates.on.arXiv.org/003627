In this paper, we review the key figures of merit to assess the performance of advanced random access
(RA) schemes exploiting physical layer coding, repetitions and collision resolution techniques.
We then investigate RA modeling aspects and their impact on the figures of merit for the exemplary
advanced RA schemes: Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), Irregular Repetition
Slotted ALOHA (IRSA), Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA) and Enhanced Spread-Spectrum ALOHA (E-SSA). We
show that typical simplifications of the reception model when used to optimize RA schemes lead to
inaccurate findings, both in terms of parameter optimization and figures of merit, such as the packet
loss ratio (PLR) and throughput. We also derive a generic RA energy efficiency model able to compare
the schemes in terms of the energy required to transmit a packet. The combination of achievable RA
throughput at the target PLR and energy efficiency, for the same average user power investment per
frame and occupied bandwidth, shows that E-SSA, which is an unslotted scheme, provides the best
overall performance, while, in terms of the slotted schemes, CRDSA outperforms the more elaborated
IRSA and CSA. This surprising results is due to the fact that the IRSA and CSA optimization has so far
been performed using RA channel models that are not accurately reflecting the physical layer receiver
behavior. We conclude by providing insights on how to include more accurate reception models in
the IRSA and CSA design and optimization.
