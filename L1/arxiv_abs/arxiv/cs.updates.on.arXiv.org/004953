Triggered by modern technologies, our possibilities may now expand beyond the unthinkable. Cars
externally may look similar to decades ago, but a dramatic revolution happened inside the cabin
as a result of their computation, communications, and storage capabilities. With the advent of
Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs), Artificial Intelligence and ecological technologies found
the best synergy. Several transportation problems may be solved (accidents, emissions, and congestion
among others), and the foundation of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) economy could be established, in
addition to value-added services such as infotainment (information and entertainment). In the
world where intelligent technologies are pervading everyday life, software and algorithms play
a major role. Software has been lately introduced in virtually every technological product available
on the market, from phones to television sets to cars and even housing. Artificial Intelligence
is one of the consequences of this pervasive presence of algorithms. The role of software is becoming
dominant and technology is, at times pervasive, of our existence. Concerns, such as privacy and
security, demand high attention and have been already explored to some level of detail. However,
intelligent agents and actors are often considered as perfect entities that will overcome human
error-prone nature. This may not always be the case and we advocate that the notion of reputation
is also applicable to intelligent artificial agents, in particular to EAVs.
