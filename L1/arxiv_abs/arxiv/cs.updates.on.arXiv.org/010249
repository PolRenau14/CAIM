Circuit obfuscation is a recently proposed defense mechanism to protect digital integrated circuits
(ICs) from reverse engineering by using camouflaged gates i.e., logic gates whose functionality
cannot be precisely determined by the attacker. There have been effective schemes such as satisfiability-checking
(SAT)-based attacks that can potentially decrypt obfuscated circuits, called deobfuscation.
Deobfuscation runtime could have a large span ranging from few milliseconds to thousands of years
or more, depending on the number and layouts of the ICs and camouflaged gates. And hence accurately
pre-estimating the deobfuscation runtime is highly crucial for the defenders to maximize it and
optimize their defense. However, estimating the deobfuscation runtime is a challenging task due
to 1) the complexity and heterogeneity of graph-structured circuit, 2) the unknown and sophisticated
mechanisms of the attackers for deobfuscation. To address the above mentioned challenges, this
work proposes the first machine-learning framework that predicts the deobfuscation runtime based
on graph deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a new model, ICNet with new input and
convolution layers to characterize and extract graph frequencies from ICs, which are then integrated
by heterogeneous deep fully-connected layers to obtain final output. ICNet is an end-to-end framework
which can automatically extract the determinant features for deobfuscation runtime. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.
