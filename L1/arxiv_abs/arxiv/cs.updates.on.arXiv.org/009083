Recursive query processing has experienced a recent resurgence, as a result of its use in many modern
application domains, including data integration, graph analytics, security, program analysis,
networking and decision making. Due to the large volumes of data being processed, several research
efforts, across multiple communities, have explored how to scale up recursive queries, typically
expressed in Datalog. Our experience with these tools indicated that their performance does not
translate across domains (e.g., a tool design for large-scale graph analytics does not exhibit
the same performance on program-analysis tasks, and vice versa). As a result, we designed and implemented
a general-purpose Datalog engine, called RecStep, on top of a parallel single-node relational
system. In this paper, we outline the different techniques we use in RecStep, and the contribution
of each technique to overall performance. We also present results from a detailed set of experiments
comparing RecStep with a number of other Datalog systems using both graph analytics and program-analysis
tasks, summarizing pros and cons of existing techniques based on the analysis of our observations.
We show that RecStep generally outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel Datalog engines on complex
and large-scale Datalog program evaluation, by a 4-6X margin. An additional insight from our work
is that we show that it is possible to build a high-performance Datalog system on top of a relational
engine, an idea that has been dismissed in past work in this area.
