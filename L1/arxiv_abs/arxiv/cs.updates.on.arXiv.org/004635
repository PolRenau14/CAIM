Led by the success of neural style transfer on visual arts, there has been a rising trend very recently
in the effort of music style transfer. However, "music style" is not yet a well-defined concept from
a scientific point of view. The difficulty lies in the intrinsic multi-level and multi-modal character
of music representation (which is very different from image representation). As a result, depending
on their interpretation of "music style", current studies under the category of "music style transfer",
are actually solving completely different problems that belong to a variety of sub-fields of Computer
Music. Also, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which aims at dealing with all levels of music representation
at once by directly adopting the method of image style transfer, leads to poor results. Thus, we see
a vital necessity to re-define music style transfer more precisely and scientifically based on
the uniqueness of music representation, as well as to connect different aspects of music style transfer
with existing well-established sub-fields of computer music studies. Otherwise, an accumulated
upcoming literature (all named after music style transfer) will lead to a great confusion of the
underlying problems as well as negligence of the treasures in computer music before the age of deep
learning. In addition, we discuss the current limitations of music style modeling and its future
directions by drawing spirit from some deep generative models, especially the ones using unsupervised
learning and disentanglement techniques.
