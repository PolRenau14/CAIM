Multi-core architectures can be leveraged to allow independent processes to run in parallel. However,
due to resources shared across cores, such as caches, distinct processes may interfere with one
another, e.g. affecting execution time. Analysing the extent of this interference is difficult
due to: (1) the diversity of modern architectures, which may contain different implementations
of shared resources, and (2) the complex nature of modern processors, in which interference might
arise due to subtle interactions. To address this, we propose a black-box auto-tuning approach
that searches for processes that are effective at causing slowdowns for a program when executed
in parallel. Such slowdowns provide lower bounds on worst-case execution time; an important metric
in systems with real-time constraints. Our approach considers a set of parameterised "enemy" processes
and "victim" programs, each targeting a shared resource. The autotuner searches for enemy process
parameters that are effective at causing slowdowns in the victim programs. The idea is that victim
programs behave as a proxy for shared resource usage of arbitrary programs. We evaluate our approach
on: 5 different chips; 3 resources (cache, memory bus, and main memory); and consider several search
strategies and slowdown metrics. Using enemy processes tuned per chip, we evaluate the slowdowns
on the autobench and coremark benchmark suites and show that our method is able to achieve slowdowns
in 98% of benchmark/chip combinations and provide similar results to manually written enemy processes.
