Understanding tie strength in social networks, and the factors that influence it, have received
much attention in a myriad of disciplines for decades. Several models incorporating indicators
of tie strength have been proposed and used to quantify relationships in social networks, and a standard
set of structural network metrics have been applied to predominantly online social media sites
to predict tie strength. Here, we introduce the concept of the "social bow tie" framework, a small
subgraph of the network that consists of a collection of nodes and ties that surround a tie of interest,
forming a topological structure that resembles a bow tie. We also define several intuitive and interpretable
metrics that quantify properties of the bow tie. We use random forests and regression models to predict
categorical and continuous measures of tie strength from different properties of the bow tie, including
nodal attributes. We also investigate what aspects of the bow tie are most predictive of tie strength
in two distinct social networks: a collection of 75 rural villages in India and a nationwide call
network of European mobile phone users. Our results indicate several of the bow tie metrics are highly
predictive of tie strength, and we find the more the social circles of two individuals overlap, the
stronger their tie, consistent with previous findings. However, we also find that the more tightly-knit
their non-overlapping social circles, the weaker the tie. This new finding complements our current
understanding of what drives the strength of ties in social networks.
