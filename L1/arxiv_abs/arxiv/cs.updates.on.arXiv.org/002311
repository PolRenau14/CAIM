We introduce a novel method for defining geographic districts in road networks using stable matching.
In this approach, each geographic district is defined in terms of a center, which identifies a location
of interest, such as a post office or polling place, and all other network vertices must be labeled
with the center to which they are associated. We focus on defining geographic districts that are
equitable, in that every district has the same number of vertices and the assignment is stable in
terms of geographic distance. That is, there is no unassigned vertex-center pair such that both
would prefer each other over their current assignments. We solve this problem using a version of
the classic stable matching problem, called symmetric stable matching, in which the preferences
of the elements in both sets obey a certain symmetry. In our case, we study a graph-based version of
stable matching in which nodes are stably matched to a subset of nodes denoted as centers, prioritized
by their shortest-path distances, so that each center is apportioned a certain number of nodes.
We show that, for a planar graph or road network with $n$ nodes and $k$ centers, the problem can be solved
in $O(n\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time, which improves upon the $O(nk)$ runtime of using the classic Gale-Shapley
stable matching algorithm when $k$ is large. Finally, we provide experimental results on road networks
for these algorithms and a heuristic algorithm that performs better than the Gale-Shapley algorithm
for any range of values of $k$.
