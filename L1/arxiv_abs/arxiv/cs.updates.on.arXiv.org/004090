White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly found in the brains of healthy elderly individuals
and have been associated with various neurological and geriatric disorders. In this paper, we present
a study using deep fully convolutional network and ensemble models to automatically detect such
WMH using fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The
algorithm was evaluated and ranked 1 st in the WMH Segmentation Challenge at MICCAI 2017. In the evaluation
stage, the implementation of the algorithm was submitted to the challenge organizers, who then
independently tested it on a hidden set of 110 cases from 5 scanners. Averaged dice score, precision
and robust Hausdorff distance obtained on held-out test datasets were 80%, 84% and 6.30mm respectively.
These were the highest achieved in the challenge, suggesting the proposed method is the state-of-the-art.
In this paper, we provide detailed descriptions and quantitative analysis on key components of
the system. Furthermore, a study of cross-scanner evaluation is presented to discuss how the combination
of modalities and data augmentation affect the generalization capability of the system. The adaptability
of the system to different scanners and protocols is also investigated. A quantitative study is
further presented to test the effect of ensemble size. Additionally, software and models of our
method are made publicly available. The effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed
system show its potential for real-world clinical practice.
