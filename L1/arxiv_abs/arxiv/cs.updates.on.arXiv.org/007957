This paper studies the problem of estimating origin-destination (OD) flows from link flows. As
the number of link flows is typically much less than that of OD flows, the inverse problem is severely
ill-posed and hence prior information is required to recover the ground truth. The basic approach
in the literature relies on a forward model where the so called traffic assignment matrix maps OD
flows to link flows. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem, prior information on the assignment
matrix and OD flows are typically needed. The main contributions of this paper include a dimension
reduction of the inquired flows from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and a demonstration that for the first time
the ground truth OD flows can be uniquely identified with no or little prior information. To cope
with the ill-posedness due to the large number of unknowns, a new forward model is developed which
does not involve OD flows directly but is built upon the flows characterized only by their origins,
henceforth referred as O-flows. The new model preserves all the OD information and more importantly
reduces the dimension of the inverse problem substantially. A Gauss-Seidel method is deployed
to solve the inverse problem, and a necessary condition for the uniqueness of the solution is proved.
Simulations demonstrate that blind estimation where no prior information is available is possible
for some network settings. Some challenging network settings are identified and discussed, where
a remedy based on temporal patterns of the O-flows is developed and numerically shown effective.
