In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing IGA-suitable planar B-spline parameterizations
from given complex CAD boundaries consisting of a set of B-spline curves. Instead of forming the
computational domain by a simple boundary, planar domains with high genus and more complex boundary
curves are considered. Firstly, some pre-processing operations including B\'ezier extraction
and subdivision are performed on each boundary curve in order to generate a high-quality planar
parameterization; then a robust planar domain partition framework is proposed to construct high-quality
patch-meshing results with few singularities from the discrete boundary formed by connecting
the end points of the resulting boundary segments. After the topology information generation of
quadrilateral decomposition, the optimal placement of interior B\'ezier curves corresponding
to the interior edges of the quadrangulation is constructed by a global optimization method to achieve
a patch-partition with high quality. Finally, after the imposition of C1=G1-continuity constraints
on the interface of neighboring B\'ezier patches with respect to each quad in the quadrangulation,
the high-quality B\'ezier patch parameterization is obtained by a C1-constrained local optimization
method to achieve uniform and orthogonal iso-parametric structures while keeping the continuity
conditions between patches. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated
by several examples which are compared to results obtained by the skeleton-based parameterization
approach.
