The increasing digitization of political speech has opened the door to studying a new dimension
of political behavior using text analysis. This work investigates the value of word-level statistical
data from the US Congressional Record--which contains the full text of all speeches made in the US
Congress--for studying the ideological positions and behavior of senators. Applying machine
learning techniques, we use this data to automatically classify senators according to party, obtaining
accuracy in the 70-95% range depending on the specific method used. We also show that using text to
predict DW-NOMINATE scores, a common proxy for ideology, does not improve upon these already-successful
results. This classification deteriorates when applied to text from sessions of Congress that
are four or more years removed from the training set, pointing to a need on the part of voters to dynamically
update the heuristics they use to evaluate party based on political speech. Text-based predictions
are less accurate than those based on voting behavior, supporting the theory that roll-call votes
represent greater commitment on the part of politicians and are thus a more accurate reflection
of their ideological preferences. However, the overall success of the machine learning approaches
studied here demonstrates that political speeches are highly predictive of partisan affiliation.
In addition to these findings, this work also introduces the computational tools and methods relevant
to the use of political speech data.
