We consider discrete-time dynamics, for cascading failure in DC networks, whose map is composition
of failure rule with control actions. Supply-demand at the nodes is monotonically non-increasing
under admissible control. Under the failure rule, a link is removed permanently if its flow exceeds
capacity constraints. We consider finite horizon optimal control to steer the network from an arbitrary
initial state, defined in terms of active link set and supply-demand at the nodes, to a feasible state,
i.e., a state which is invariant under the failure rule. There is no running cost and the reward associated
with a feasible terminal state is the associated cumulative supply-demand. We propose two approaches
for computing optimal control. The first approach, geared towards tree reducible networks, decomposes
the global problem into a system of coupled local problems, which can be solved to optimality in two
iterations. When restricted to the class of one-shot control actions, the optimal solutions to
the local problems possess a piecewise affine property, which facilitates analytical solution.
The second approach computes optimal control by searching over the reachable set, which is shown
to admit an equivalent finite representation by aggregation of control actions leading to the same
reachable active link set. An algorithmic procedure to construct this representation is provided
by leveraging and extending tools for arrangement of hyperplanes and polytopes. Illustrative
simulations, including showing the effectiveness of a projection-based approximation algorithm,
are also presented.
