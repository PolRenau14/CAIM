When many clones are detected in software programs, not all clones are equally important to developers.
To help developers refactor code and improve software quality, various tools were built to recommend
clone-removal refactorings based on the past and the present information, such as the cohesion
degree of individual clones or the co-evolution relations of clone peers. The existence of these
tools inspired us to build an approach that considers as many factors as possible to more accurately
recommend clones. This paper introduces CREC, a learning-based approach that recommends clones
by extracting features from the current status and past history of software projects. Given a set
of software repositories, CREC first automatically extracts the clone groups historically refactored
(R-clones) and those not refactored (NR-clones) to construct the training set. CREC extracts 34
features to characterize the content and evolution behaviors of individual clones, as well as the
spatial, syntactical, and co-change relations of clone peers. With these features, CREC trains
a classifier that recommends clones for refactoring. We designed the largest feature set thus far
for clone recommendation, and performed an evaluation on six large projects. The results show that
our approach suggested refactorings with 83% and 76% F-scores in the within-project and cross-project
settings. CREC significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art similar approach on our data set,
with the latter one achieving 70% and 50% F-scores. We also compared the effectiveness of different
factors and different learning algorithms.
