With the fast development of Internet of things (IoT), the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks
need to provide massive connectivity of IoT devices and meet the demand for low latency. To satisfy
these requirements, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been recognized as a promising
solution for 5G networks to significantly improve the network capacity. In parallel with the development
of NOMA techniques, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is becoming one of the key emerging technologies
to reduce the latency and improve the Quality of Service (QoS) for 5G networks. In order to capture
the potential gains of NOMA in the context of MEC, this paper proposes an edge computing aware NOMA
technique which can enjoy the benefits of uplink NOMA in reducing MEC users' uplink energy consumption.
To this end, we formulate a NOMA based optimization framework which minimizes the energy consumption
of MEC users via optimizing the user clustering, computing and communication resource allocation,
and transmit powers. In particular, similar to frequency Resource Blocks (RBs), we divide the computing
capacity available at the cloudlet to computing RBs. Accordingly, we explore the joint allocation
of the frequency and computing RBs to the users that are assigned to different order indices within
the NOMA clusters. We also design an efficient heuristic algorithm for user clustering and RBs allocation,
and formulate a convex optimization problem for the power control to be solved independently per
NOMA cluster. The performance of the proposed NOMA scheme is evaluated via simulations.
