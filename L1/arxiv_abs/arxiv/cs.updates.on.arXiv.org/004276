In this paper, we aim at the automated unit coverage-based testing for embedded software. To achieve
the goal, by analyzing the industrial requirements and our previous work on automated unit testing
tool CAUT, we rebuild a new tool, SmartUnit, to solve the engineering requirements that take place
in our partner companies. SmartUnit is a dynamic symbolic execution implementation, which supports
statement, branch, boundary value and MC/DC coverage. SmartUnit has been used to test more than
one million lines of code in real projects. For confidentiality motives, we select three in-house
real projects for the empirical evaluations. We also carry out our evaluations on two open source
database projects, SQLite and PostgreSQL, to test the scalability of our tool since the scale of
the embedded software project is mostly not large, 5K-50K lines of code on average. From our experimental
results, in general, more than 90% of functions in commercial embedded software achieve 100% statement,
branch, MC/DC coverage, more than 80% of functions in SQLite achieve 100% MC/DC coverage, and more
than 60% of functions in PostgreSQL achieve 100% MC/DC coverage. Moreover, SmartUnit is able to
find the runtime exceptions at the unit testing level. We also have reported exceptions like array
index out of bounds and divided-by-zero in SQLite. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons of low coverage
in automated unit testing in our setting and give a survey on the situation of manual unit testing
with respect to automated unit testing in industry.
