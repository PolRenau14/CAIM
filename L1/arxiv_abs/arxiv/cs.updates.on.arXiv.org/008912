Compared with facial emotion recognition on categorical model, the dimensional emotion recognition
can describe numerous emotions of the real world more accurately. Most prior works of dimensional
emotion estimation only considered laboratory data and used video, speech or other multi-modal
features. The effect of these methods applied on static images in the real world is unknown. In this
paper, a two-level attention with two-stage multi-task learning (2Att-2Mt) framework is proposed
for facial emotion estimation on only static images. Firstly, the features of corresponding region(position-level
features) are extracted and enhanced automatically by first-level attention mechanism. In the
following, we utilize Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network(Bi-RNN) with self-attention(second-level
attention) to make full use of the relationship features of different layers(layer-level features)
adaptively. Owing to the inherent complexity of dimensional emotion recognition, we propose a
two-stage multi-task learning structure to exploited categorical representations to ameliorate
the dimensional representations and estimate valence and arousal simultaneously in view of the
correlation of the two targets. The quantitative results conducted on AffectNet dataset show significant
advancement on Concordance Correlation Coefficient(CCC) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), illustrating
the superiority of the proposed framework. Besides, extensive comparative experiments have also
fully demonstrated the effectiveness of different components.
