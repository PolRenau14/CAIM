Previous research about sensor based attacks on Android platform focused mainly on accessing or
controlling over sensitive device components, such as camera, microphone and GPS. These approaches
get data from sensors directly and need corresponding sensor invoking permissions. This paper
presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission bypassing attacks from a zero permission
Android application (VoicEmployer) through the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an Android
system built-in voice assistant module -- Google Voice Search. Through Android Intent mechanism,
VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice Search to the foreground, and then plays prepared audio files
(like "call number 1234 5678") in the background. Google Voice Search can recognize this voice command
and execute corresponding operations. With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge SMS/Email,
access privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve remote control without any permission.
Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app, which can be utilized by GVS-Attack
to dial arbitrary numbers even when the phone is securely locked with password. A prototype of VoicEmployer
has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly
all Android devices equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by GVS-Attack. This
study may inspire application developers and researchers rethink that zero permission doesn't
mean safety and the speaker can be treated as a new attack surface.
