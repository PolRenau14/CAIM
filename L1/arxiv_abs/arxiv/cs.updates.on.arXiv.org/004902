Efficient estimation of wideband spectrum is of great importance for applications such as cognitive
radio. Recently, sub-Nyquist sampling schemes based on compressed sensing have been proposed
to greatly reduce the sampling rate. However, the important issue of quantization has not been fully
addressed, particularly for high-resolution spectrum and parameter estimation. In this paper,
we aim to recover spectrally-sparse signals and the corresponding parameters, such as frequency
and amplitudes, from heavy quantizations of their noisy complex-valued random linear measurements,
e.g. only the quadrant information. We first characterize the Cramer-Rao bound under Gaussian
noise, which highlights the trade-off between sample complexity and bit depth under different
signal-to-noise ratios for a fixed budget of bits. Next, we propose a new algorithm based on atomic
norm soft thresholding for signal recovery, which is equivalent to proximal mapping of properly
designed surrogate signals with respect to the atomic norm that motivates spectral sparsity. The
proposed algorithm can be applied to both the single measurement vector case, as well as the multiple
measurement vector case. It is shown that under the Gaussian measurement model, the spectral signals
can be reconstructed accurately with high probability, as soon as the number of quantized measurements
exceeds the order of K log n, where K is the level of spectral sparsity and $n$ is the signal dimension.
Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate the proposed approaches.
