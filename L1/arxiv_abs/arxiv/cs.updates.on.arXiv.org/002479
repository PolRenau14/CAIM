We introduce Tiered Sampling, a novel technique for approximate counting sparse motifs in massive
graphs whose edges are observed in a stream. Our technique requires only a single pass on the data
and uses a memory of fixed size $M$, which can be magnitudes smaller than the number of edges. Our methods
addresses the challenging task of counting sparse motifs - sub-graph patterns that have low probability
to appear in a sample of $M$ edges in the graph, which is the maximum amount of data available to the
algorithms in each step. To obtain an unbiased and low variance estimate of the count we partition
the available memory to tiers (layers) of reservoir samples. While the base layer is a standard reservoir
sample of edges, other layers are reservoir samples of sub-structures of the desired motif. By storing
more frequent sub-structures of the motif, we increase the probability of detecting an occurrence
of the sparse motif we are counting, thus decreasing the variance and error of the estimate. We demonstrate
the advantage of our method in the specific applications of counting sparse 4 and 5-cliques in massive
graphs. We present a complete analytical analysis and extensive experimental results using both
synthetic and real-world data. Our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in obtaining
high-quality approximations for the number of 4 and 5-cliques for large graphs using a very limited
amount of memory, significantly outperforming the single edge sample approach for counting sparse
motifs in large scale graphs.
