Some scientists write literary fiction books in their spare time. If these books contain scientific
knowledge, literary fiction becomes a mechanism of knowledge transfer. In this case, we could conceptualize
literary fiction as non-formal knowledge transfer. We model knowledge transfer via literary fiction
as a function of the type of scientist (academic or non-academic) and his/her scientific field.
Academic scientists are those employed in academia and public research organizations whereas
non-academic scientists are those with a scientific background employed in other sectors. We also
distinguish between direct knowledge transfer (the book includes the scientist's research topics),
indirect knowledge transfer (scientific authors talk about their research with cultural agents)
and reverse knowledge transfer (cultural agents give scientists ideas for future research). Through
mixed-methods research and a sample from Spain, we find that scientific authorship accounts for
a considerable percentage of all literary fiction authorship. Academic scientists do not transfer
knowledge directly so often as non-academic scientists, but the former engage into indirect and
reverse transfer knowledge more often than the latter. Scientists from History stand out in direct
knowledge transfer. We draw propositions about the role of the academic logic and scientific field
on knowledge transfer via literary fiction. We advance some tentative conclusions regarding the
consideration of scientific authorship of literary fiction as a valuable knowledge transfer mechanism.
