Estimating count and density maps from crowd images has a wide range of applications such as video
surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. In addition, techniques
developed for crowd counting can be applied to related tasks in other fields of study such as cell
microscopy, vehicle counting and environmental survey. The task of crowd counting and density
map estimation is riddled with many challenges such as occlusions, non-uniform density, intra-scene
and inter-scene variations in scale and perspective. Nevertheless, over the last few years, crowd
count analysis has evolved from earlier methods that are often limited to small variations in crowd
density and scales to the current state-of-the-art methods that have developed the ability to perform
successfully on a wide range of scenarios. The success of crowd counting methods in the recent years
can be largely attributed to deep learning and publications of challenging datasets. In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive survey of recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches
that have demonstrated significant improvements over earlier methods that rely largely on hand-crafted
representations. First, we briefly review the pioneering methods that use hand-crafted representations
and then we delve in detail into the deep learning-based approaches and recently published datasets.
Furthermore, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of existing CNN-based approaches and identify
promising avenues of research in this rapidly evolving field.
