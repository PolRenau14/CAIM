We consider infinite duration alternating move games. These games were previously studied by Roth,
Balcan, Kalai and Mansour. They presented an FPTAS for computing an approximated equilibrium,
and conjectured that there is a polynomial algorithm for finding an exact equilibrium. We extend
their study in two directions: (1) We show that finding an exact equilibrium, even for two-player
zero-sum games, is polynomial time equivalent to finding a winning strategy for a (two-player)
mean-payoff game on graphs. The existence of a polynomial algorithm for the latter is a long standing
open question in computer science. Our hardness result for two-player games suggests that two-player
alternating move games are harder to solve than two-player simultaneous move games, while the work
of Roth et al., suggests that for $k\geq 3$, $k$-player games are easier to analyze in the alternating
move setting. (2) We show that optimal equilibriums (with respect to the social welfare metric)
can be obtained by pure strategies, and we present an FPTAS for computing a pure approximated equilibrium
that is $\delta$-optimal with respect to the social welfare metric. This result extends the previous
work by presenting an FPTAS that finds a much more desirable approximated equilibrium. We also show
that if there is a polynomial algorithm for mean-payoff games on graphs, then there is a polynomial
algorithm that computes an optimal exact equilibrium, and hence, (two-player) mean-payoff games
on graphs are inter-reducible with $k$-player alternating move games, for any $k\geq 2$.
