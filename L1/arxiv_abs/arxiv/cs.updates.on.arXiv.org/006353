Ever-increasing amounts of data are created and processed in internet-scale companies such as
Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The efficient storage of such copious amounts of data has thus become
a fundamental and acute problem in modern computing. No single machine can possibly satisfy such
immense storage demands. Therefore, distributed storage systems (DSS), which rely on tens of thousands
of storage nodes, are the only viable solution. Such systems are broadly used in all modern internet-scale
systems. However, the design of a DSS poses a number of crucial challenges, markedly different from
single-user storage systems. Such systems must be able to reconstruct the data efficiently, to
overcome failure of servers, to correct errors, etc. Lots of research was done in the last few years
to answer these challenges and the research is increasing in parallel to the increasing amount of
stored data. The main goal of this paper is to consider codes which have two of the most important features
of distributed storage systems, namely, locality and availability. Our codes are array codes which
are based on subspaces of a linear space over a finite field. We present several constructions of
such codes which are $q$-analog to some of the known block codes. Some of these codes possess independent
intellectual merit. We examine the locality and availability of the constructed codes. In particular
we distinguish between two types of locality and availability, node vs.~symbol, locality and availability.
To our knowledge this is the first time that such a distinction is given in the literature.
