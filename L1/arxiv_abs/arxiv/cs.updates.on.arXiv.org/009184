In this paper, we develop machinery which makes it much easier to prove sum of squares lower bounds
when the problem is symmetric under permutations of $[1,n]$ and the unsatisfiability of our problem
comes from integrality arguments, i.e. arguments that an expression must be an integer. Roughly
speaking, to prove SOS lower bounds with our machinery it is sufficient to verify that the answer
to the following three questions is yes: 1. Are there natural pseudo-expectation values for the
problem? 2. Are these pseudo-expectation values rational functions of the problem parameters?
3. Are there sufficiently many values of the parameters for which these pseudo-expectation values
correspond to the actual expected values over a distribution of solutions which is the uniform distribution
over permutations of a single solution? We demonstrate our machinery on three problems, the knapsack
problem analyzed by Grigoriev, the MOD 2 principle (which says that the complete graph $K_n$ has
no perfect matching when $n$ is odd), and the following Turan type problem: Minimize the number of
triangles in a graph $G$ with a given edge density. For knapsack, we recover Grigoriev's lower bound
exactly. For the MOD 2 principle, we tighten Grigoriev's linear degree sum of squares lower bound,
making it exact. Finally, for the triangle problem, we prove a sum of squares lower bound for finding
the minimum triangle density. This lower bound is completely new and gives a simple example where
constant degree sum of squares methods have a constant factor error in estimating graph densities.
