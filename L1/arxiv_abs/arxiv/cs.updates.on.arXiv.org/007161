Mobile edge caching enables content delivery within the radio access network, which effectively
alleviates the backhaul burden and reduces response time. To fully exploit edge storage resources,
the most popular contents should be identified and cached. Observing that user demands on certain
contents vary greatly at different locations, this paper devises location-customized caching
schemes to maximize the total content hit rate. Specifically, a linear model is used to estimate
the future content hit rate. For the case where the model noise is zero-mean, a ridge regression based
online algorithm with positive perturbation is proposed. Regret analysis indicates that the proposed
algorithm asymptotically approaches the optimal caching strategy in the long run. When the noise
structure is unknown, an $H_{\infty}$ filter based online algorithm is further proposed by taking
a prescribed threshold as input, which guarantees prediction accuracy even under the worst-case
noise process. Both online algorithms require no training phases, and hence are robust to the time-varying
user demands. The underlying causes of estimation errors of both algorithms are numerically analyzed.
Moreover, extensive experiments on real world dataset are conducted to validate the applicability
of the proposed algorithms. It is demonstrated that those algorithms can be applied to scenarios
with different noise features, and are able to make adaptive caching decisions, achieving content
hit rate that is comparable to that via the hindsight optimal strategy.
