We study the classical rumor spreading problem, which is used to spread information in an unknown
network with $n$ nodes. We present the first protocol for any expander graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and
minimum degree $\Theta(n)$ such that, the protocol informs every node in $O(\log n)$ rounds with
high probability, and uses $O(\log n\log\log n)$ random bits in total. The runtime of our protocol
is tight, and the randomness requirement of $O(\log n\log\log n)$ random bits almost matches the
lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ random bits. We further study rumor spreading protocols for more
general graphs, and for several graph topologies our protocols are as fast as the classical protocol
and use $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ random bits in total, in contrast to $O(n\log^2n)$ random bits used
in the well-known rumor spreading push protocol. These results together give us almost full understanding
of the randomness requirement for this basic epidemic process. Our protocols rely on a novel reduction
between rumor spreading processes and branching programs, and this reduction provides a general
framework to derandomize these complex and distributed epidemic processes. Interestingly, one
cannot simply apply PRGs for branching programs as rumor spreading process is not characterized
by small-space computation. Our protocols require the composition of several pseudorandom objects,
e.g. pseudorandom generators, and pairwise independent generators. Besides designing rumor
spreading protocols, the techniques developed here may have applications in studying the randomness
complexity of distributed algorithms.
