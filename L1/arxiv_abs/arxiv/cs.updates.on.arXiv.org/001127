Background: Cancers are highly heterogeneous with different subtypes. These subtypes often possess
different genetic variants, present different pathological phenotypes, and most importantly,
show various clinical outcomes such as varied prognosis and response to treatment and likelihood
for recurrence and metastasis. Recently, integrative genomics (or panomics) approaches are often
adopted with the goal of combining multiple types of omics data to identify integrative biomarkers
for stratification of patients into groups with different clinical outcomes. Results: In this
paper we present a visual analytic system called Interactive Genomics Patient Stratification
explorer (iGPSe) which significantly reduces the computing burden for biomedical researchers
in the process of exploring complicated integrative genomics data. Our system integrates unsupervised
clustering with graph and parallel sets visualization and allows direct comparison of clinical
outcomes via survival analysis. Using a breast cancer dataset obtained from the The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) project, we are able to quickly explore different combinations of gene expression
(mRNA) and microRNA features and identify potential combined markers for survival prediction.
Conclusions: Visualization plays an important role in the process of stratifying given population
patients. Visual tools allowed for the selection of possibly features across various datasets
for the given patient population. We essentially made a case for visualization for a very important
problem in translational informatics.
