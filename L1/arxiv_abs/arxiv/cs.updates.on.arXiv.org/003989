Visual object tracking is an important computer vision problem with numerous real-world applications
including human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, robotics, motion-based recognition,
video indexing, surveillance and security. In this paper, we aim to extensively review the latest
trends and advances in the tracking algorithms and evaluate the robustness of trackers in the presence
of noise. The first part of this work comprises a comprehensive survey of recently proposed tracking
algorithms. We broadly categorize trackers into correlation filter based trackers and the others
as non-correlation filter trackers. Each category is further classified into various types of
trackers based on the architecture of the tracking mechanism. In the second part of this work, we
experimentally evaluate tracking algorithms for robustness in the presence of additive white
Gaussian noise. Multiple levels of additive noise are added to the Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB)
2015, and the precision and success rates of the tracking algorithms are evaluated. Some algorithms
suffered more performance degradation than others, which brings to light a previously unexplored
aspect of the tracking algorithms. The relative rank of the algorithms based on their performance
on benchmark datasets may change in the presence of noise. Our study concludes that no single tracker
is able to achieve the same efficiency in the presence of noise as under noise-free conditions; thus,
there is a need to include a parameter for robustness to noise when evaluating newly proposed tracking
algorithms.
