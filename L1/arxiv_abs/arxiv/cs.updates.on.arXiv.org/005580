Wireless communication environments are unaware of the ongoing data exchange efforts within them.
Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is intractable in all but the simplest cases.
The present work proposes a new paradigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and,
subsequently, optimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering
can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting waves towards any
custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled
and mitigated. The core technology of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures
whose effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their macro-structure. The
present study contributes the software-programmable wireless environment model, consisting
of several HyperSurface tiles controlled by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces
are a novel class of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered
and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat indoor objects, allowing
fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or polarization overall. A central server
calculates and deploys the optimal electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating
devices. Realistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking potential
of the proposed approach in 2.4 GHz and 60 GHz frequencies.
