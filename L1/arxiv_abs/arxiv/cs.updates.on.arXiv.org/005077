Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). A reliable
measure of the tissue myelin content is therefore essential for the understanding of the physiopathology
of MS, tracking progression and assessing treatment efficacy. Positron emission tomography (PET)
with $[^{11} \mbox{C}] \mbox{PIB}$ has been proposed as a promising biomarker for measuring myelin
content changes in-vivo in MS. However, PET imaging is expensive and invasive due to the injection
of a radioactive tracer. On the contrary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive, widely
available technique, but existing MRI sequences do not provide, to date, a reliable, specific,
or direct marker of either demyelination or remyelination. In this work, we therefore propose Sketcher-Refiner
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with specifically designed adversarial loss functions
to predict the PET-derived myelin content map from a combination of MRI modalities. The prediction
problem is solved by a sketch-refinement process in which the sketcher generates the preliminary
anatomical and physiological information and the refiner refines and generates images reflecting
the tissue myelin content in the human brain. We evaluated the ability of our method to predict myelin
content at both global and voxel-wise levels. The evaluation results show that the demyelination
in lesion regions and myelin content in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) can be well predicted
by our method. The method has the potential to become a useful tool for clinical management of patients
with MS.
