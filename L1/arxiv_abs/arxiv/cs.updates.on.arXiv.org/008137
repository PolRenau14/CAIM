For many segmentation tasks, especially for the biomedical image, the topological prior is vital
information which is useful to exploit. The containment/nesting is a typical inter-class geometric
relationship. In the MICCAI Brain tumor segmentation challenge, with its three hierarchically
nested classes 'whole tumor', 'tumor core', 'active tumor', the nested classes relationship is
introduced into the 3D-residual-Unet architecture. The network comprises a context aggregation
pathway and a localization pathway, which encodes increasingly abstract representation of the
input as going deeper into the network, and then recombines these representations with shallower
features to precisely localize the interest domain via a localization path. The nested-class-prior
is combined by proposing the multi-class activation function and its corresponding loss function.
The model is trained on the training dataset of Brats2018, and 20% of the dataset is regarded as the
validation dataset to determine parameters. When the parameters are fixed, we retrain the model
on the whole training dataset. The performance achieved on the validation leaderboard is 86%, 77%
and 72% Dice scores for the whole tumor, enhancing tumor and tumor core classes without relying on
ensembles or complicated post-processing steps. Based on the same start-of-the-art network architecture,
the accuracy of nested-class (enhancing tumor) is reasonably improved from 69% to 72% compared
with the traditional Softmax-based method which blind to topological prior.
