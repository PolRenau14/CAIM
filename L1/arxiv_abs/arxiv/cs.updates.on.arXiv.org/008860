Recently, wireless edge caching has been emerged as a promising technology for future wireless
networks to cope with exponentially increasing demands for high data rate and low latency multimedia
services by proactively storing contents at the network edge. Here, we aim to design efficient cache
placement and delivery strategies for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular network (C-HetNet) which operates in two separated phases:
caching phase (CP) and delivery phase (DP). Since guaranteeing fairness among mobile users (MUs)
is not well investigated in cache-assisted wireless networks, we first propose two delay-based
fairness schemes called proportional fairness (PF) and min-max fairness (MMF). The PF scheme deals
with minimizing the total weighted latency of MUs while MMF aims at minimizing the maximum latency
among them. In the CP, we propose a novel proactive fairness and transmission-aware cache placement
strategy (CPS) corresponding to each target fairness scheme by exploiting the flexible wireless
access and backhaul transmission opportunities. Specifically, we jointly perform the allocation
of physical resources as storage and radio, and user association to improve the flexibility of the
CPSs. Moreover, In the DP of each fairness scheme, an efficient delivery policy is proposed based
on the arrival requests of MUs, CSI, and caching status. Numerical assessments demonstrate that
our proposed CPSs outperform the total latency of MUs up to 27% compared to the conventional baseline
popular CPSs.
