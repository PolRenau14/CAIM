Imbalanced data with a skewed class distribution are common in many real-world applications. Deep
Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning technique that is effective in classification tasks.
However, conventional DBN does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes
equal costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches assign different
misclassification costs for different classes without disrupting the true data sample distributions.
However, due to lack of prior knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard
to choose in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive learning could
improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive
deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential
evolution to optimize the misclassification costs based on training data, that presents an effective
approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e. G-mean) into the objective function. We
first optimize the misclassification costs, then apply them to deep belief network. Adaptive differential
evolution optimization is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates
its corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge. The experiments have
shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on both benchmark
datasets and real-world dataset for fault diagnosis in tool condition monitoring.
