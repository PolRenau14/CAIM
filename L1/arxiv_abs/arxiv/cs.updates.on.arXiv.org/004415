This paper presents a massively parallel and scalable neuromorphic cortex simulator designed
for simulating large and structurally connected spiking neural networks, such as complex models
of various areas of the cortex. The main novelty of this work is the abstraction of a neuromorphic
architecture into clusters represented by minicolumns and hypercolumns, analogously to the fundamental
structural units observed in neurobiology. Without this approach, simulating large-scale fully
connected networks needs prohibitively large memory to store look-up tables for point-to-point
connections. Instead, we use a novel architecture, based on the structural connectivity in the
neocortex, such that all the required parameters and connections can be stored in on-chip memory.
The cortex simulator can be easily reconfigured for simulating different neural networks without
any change in hardware structure by programming the memory. A hierarchical communication scheme
allows one neuron to have a fan-out of up to 200k neurons. As a proof-of-concept, an implementation
on one Altera Stratix V FPGA was able to simulate 20 million to 2.6 billion leaky-integrate-and-fire
(LIF) neurons in real time. We verified the system by emulating a simplified auditory cortex (with
100 million neurons). This cortex simulator achieved a low power dissipation of 1.62 {\mu}W per
neuron. With the advent of commercially available FPGA boards, our system offers an accessible
and scalable tool for the design, real-time simulation, and analysis of large-scale spiking neural
networks.
