Chromosome classification is critical for karyotyping in abnormality diagnosis. To expedite
the diagnosis, we present a novel method named Varifocal-Net for simultaneous classification
of chromosome's type and polarity using deep convolutional networks. The approach consists of
one global-scale network (G-Net) and one local-scale network (L-Net). It follows three stages.
The first stage is to learn both global and local features. We extract global features and detect
finer local regions via the G-Net. By proposing a varifocal mechanism, we zoom into local parts and
extract local features via the L-Net. Residual learning and multi-task learning strategies are
utilized to promote high-level feature extraction. The detection of discriminative local parts
is fulfilled by a localization subnet of the G-Net, whose training process involves both supervised
and weakly-supervised learning. The second stage is to build two multi-layer perceptron classifiers
that exploit features of both two scales to boost classification performance. The third stage is
to introduce a dispatch strategy of assigning each chromosome to a type within each patient case,
by utilizing the domain knowledge of karyotyping. Evaluation results from 1909 karyotyping cases
showed that the proposed Varifocal-Net achieved the highest accuracy per patient case (%) 99.2
for both type and polarity tasks. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our varifocal mechanism, multi-scale feature ensemble, and dispatch strategy.
The proposed method has been applied to assist practical karyotype diagnosis.
