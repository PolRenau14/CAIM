We suggest a general approach to quantification of different forms of aleatoric uncertainty in
regression tasks performed by artificial neural networks. It is based on the simultaneous training
of two neural networks with a joint loss function and a specific hyperparameter $\lambda>0$ that
allows for automatically detecting noisy and clean regions in the input space and controlling their
{\em relative contribution} to the loss and its gradients. After the model has been trained, one
of the networks performs predictions and the other quantifies the uncertainty of these predictions
by estimating the locally averaged loss of the first one. Unlike in many classical uncertainty quantification
methods, we do not assume any a priori knowledge of the ground truth probability distribution, neither
do we, in general, maximize the likelihood of a chosen parametric family of distributions. We analyze
the learning process and the influence of clean and noisy regions of the input space on the loss surface,
depending on $\lambda$. In particular, we show that small values of $\lambda$ increase the relative
contribution of clean regions to the loss and its gradients. This explains why choosing small $\lambda$
allows for better predictions compared with neural networks without uncertainty counterparts
and those based on classical likelihood maximization. Finally, we demonstrate that one can naturally
form ensembles of pairs of our networks and thus capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
and avoid overfitting.
