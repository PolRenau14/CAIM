Conventional shape sensing techniques using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) involve finding the curvature
at discrete FBG active areas and integrating curvature over the length of the continuum dexterous
manipulator (CDM) for tip position estimation (TPE). However, due to limited number of sensing
locations and many geometrical assumptions, these methods are prone to large error propagation
especially when the CDM undergoes large deflections. In this paper, we study the complications
of using the conventional TPE methods that are dependent on sensor model and propose a new data-driven
method that overcomes these challenges. The proposed method consists of a regression model that
takes FBG wavelength raw data as input and directly estimates the CDM's tip position. This model
is pre-operatively (off-line) trained on position information from optical trackers/cameras
(as the ground truth) and it intra-operatively (on-line) estimates CDM tip position using only
the FBG wavelength data. The method's performance is evaluated on a CDM developed for orthopedic
applications, and the results are compared to conventional model-dependent methods during large
deflection bendings. Mean absolute TPE error (and standard deviation) of 1.52 (0.67) mm and 0.11
(0.1) mm with maximum absolute errors of 3.63 mm and 0.62 mm for the conventional and the proposed
data-driven techniques were obtained, respectively. These results demonstrate a significant
out-performance of the proposed data-driven approach versus the conventional estimation technique.
