The personnel scheduling problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial problem. Due to the complexity
of this problem and the size of the real-world instances, it is not possible to use exact methods,
and thus heuristics, meta-heuristics, or hyper-heuristics must be employed. The majority of heuristic
approaches are based on iterative search, where the quality of intermediate solutions must be calculated.
Unfortunately, this is computationally highly expensive because these problems have many constraints
and some are very complex. In this study, we propose a machine learning technique as a tool to accelerate
the evaluation phase in heuristic approaches. The solution is based on a simple classifier, which
is able to determine whether the changed solution (more precisely, the changed part of the solution)
is better than the original or not. This decision is made much faster than a standard cost-oriented
evaluation process. However, the classification process cannot guarantee 100% correctness.
Therefore, our approach, which is illustrated using a tabu search algorithm in this study, includes
a filtering mechanism, where the classifier rejects the majority of the potentially bad solutions
and the remaining solutions are then evaluated in a standard manner. We also show how the boosting
algorithms can improve the quality of the final solution compared with a simple classifier. We verified
our proposed approach and premises, based on standard and real-world benchmark instances, to demonstrate
the significant speedup obtained with comparable solution quality.
