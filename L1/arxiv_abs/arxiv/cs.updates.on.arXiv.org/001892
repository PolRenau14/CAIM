In recent years supervised representation learning has provided state of the art or close to the
state of the art results in semantic analysis tasks including ranking and information retrieval.
The core idea is to learn how to embed items into a latent space such that they optimize a supervised
objective in that latent space. The dimensions of the latent space have no clear semantics, and this
reduces the interpretability of the system. For example, in personalization models, it is hard
to explain why a particular item is ranked high for a given user profile. We propose a novel model of
representation learning called Supervised Explicit Semantic Analysis (SESA) that is trained
in a supervised fashion to embed items to a set of dimensions with explicit semantics. The model learns
to compare two objects by representing them in this explicit space, where each dimension corresponds
to a concept from a knowledge base. This work extends Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) with a supervised
model for ranking problems. We apply this model to the task of Job-Profile relevance in LinkedIn
in which a set of skills defines our explicit dimensions of the space. Every profile and job are encoded
to this set of skills their similarity is calculated in this space. We use RNNs to embed text input
into this space. In addition to interpretability, our model makes use of the web-scale collaborative
skills data that is provided by users for each LinkedIn profile. Our model provides state of the art
result while it remains interpretable.
