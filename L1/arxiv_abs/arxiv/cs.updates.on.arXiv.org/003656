There have been various studies analyzing public sentiment after a large-scale disaster. However,
few studies have focused on the relationship between public sentiment on social media and its results
on people's activities in the real world. In this paper, we conduct a long-term sentiment analysis
after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 using Facebook Pages with the aim of investigating
the correlation between public sentiment and people's actual needs in areas damaged by water disasters.
In addition, we try to analyze whether different types of disaster-related communication created
different kinds of relationships on people's activities in the physical world. Our analysis reveals
that sentiment of geo-info-related communication, which might be affected by sentiment inside
a damaged area, had a positive correlation with the prices of used cars in the damaged area. On the
other hand, the sentiment of disaster-interest-based-communication, which might be affected
more by people who were interested in the disaster, but were outside the damaged area, had a negative
correlation with the prices of used cars. The result could be interpreted to mean that when people
begin to recover, used-car prices rise because they become more positive in their sentiment. This
study suggests that, for long-term disaster-recovery analysis, we need to consider the different
characteristics of online communication posted by locals directly affected by the disaster and
non-locals not directly affected by the disaster.
