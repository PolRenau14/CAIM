We propose a new approach towards RSS (Received Signal Strength) based wireless localisation for
scenarios where, instead of absolute positioning of an object, only the information whether an
object is inside or outside of a specific area is required. This is motivated through a number of applications
including, but not limited to, a) security: detecting whether an object is removed from a secure
location, b) wireless sensor networks: detecting sensor movements outside of a network area, and
c) computational behaviour analytics: detecting customers leaving a retail store. The result
of such detection systems can naturally be utilised in building a higher level contextual understanding
of a system or user behaviours. We use a supervised learning method to overcome issues related to
RSS based localisation systems including multipath fading, shadowing, and incorrect model parameters
(as in unsupervised methods). Moreover, to reduce the cost of collecting training data, we employ
a detection method called One-Class SVM (OC-SVM) which requires only one class of data (positive
data, or target class data) for training. We derive a mathematical approximation of accuracy which
utilises the characteristics of wireless signals as well as OC-SVM. Based on this we then propose
a novel mathematical formula to find optimal placement of devices. This enables us to optimize the
placement without performing any costly experiments or simulations. We validate our proposed
mathematical framework based on simulated and real experiments.
