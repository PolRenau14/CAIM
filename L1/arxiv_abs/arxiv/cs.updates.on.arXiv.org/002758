Always, some individuals in images are more important/attractive than others in some events such
as presentation, basketball game or speech. However, it is challenging to find important people
among all individuals in images directly based on their spatial or appearance information due to
the existence of diverse variations of pose, action, appearance of persons and various changes
of occasions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing a multiple Hyper-Interaction Graph
to treat each individual in an image as a node and inferring the most active node referring to interactions
estimated by various types of clews. We model pairwise interactions between persons as the edge
message communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional pairwise-interaction graph.
To enrich the personperson interaction estimation, we further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction
graph that models the consensus of interaction between a focal person and any person in a local region
around. Finally, we modify the PageRank algorithm to infer the activeness of persons on the multiple
Hybrid-Interaction Graph (HIG), the union of the pairwise-interaction and hyperinteraction
graphs, and we call our algorithm the PersonRank. In order to provide publicable datasets for evaluation,
we have contributed a new dataset called Multi-scene Important People Image Dataset and gathered
a NCAA Basketball Image Dataset from sports game sequences. We have demonstrated that the proposed
PersonRank outperforms related methods clearly and substantially.
