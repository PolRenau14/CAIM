Previous work indicates that over the past 20 years, the highest quality work have been published
in an increasingly diverse and larger group of journals. In this paper we examine whether this diversification
has also affected the handful of elite journals that are traditionally considered to be the best.
We examine citation patterns over the past 40 years of 7 long-standing traditionally elite journals
and 6 journals that have been increasing in importance over the past 20 years. To be among the top 5%
or 1% cited papers, papers now need about twice as many citations as they did 40 years ago. Since the
late 1980s and early 1990s elite journals have been publishing a decreasing proportion of these
top cited papers. This also applies to the two journals that are typically considered as the top venues
and often used as bibliometric indicators of "excellence", Science and Nature. On the other hand,
several new and established journals are publishing an increasing proportion of most cited papers.
These changes bring new challenges and opportunities for all parties. Journals can enact policies
to increase or maintain their relative position in the journal hierarchy. Researchers now have
the option to publish in more diverse venues knowing that their work can still reach the same audiences.
Finally, evaluators and administrators need to know that although there will always be a certain
prestige associated with publishing in "elite" journals, journal hierarchies are in constant
flux so inclusion of journals into this group is not permanent.
