Quantitative methods to measure the participation to parliamentary debate and discourse of elected
Members of Parliament (MPs) and the parties they belong to are lacking. This is an exploratory study
in which we propose the development of a new approach for a quantitative analysis of such participation.
We utilize the New Zealand government's digital Hansard database to construct a topic model of parliamentary
speeches consisting of nearly 40 million words in the period 2003-2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation
topic model is implemented in order to reveal the thematic structure of our set of documents. This
generative statistical model enables the detection of major themes or topics that are publicly
discussed in the New Zealand parliament, as well as permitting their classification by MP. Information
on topic proportions is subsequently analyzed using a combination of statistical methods. We observe
patterns arising from time-series analysis of topic frequencies which can be related to specific
social, economic and legislative events. We then construct a bipartite network representation,
linking MPs to topics, for each of four parliamentary terms in this time frame. We build projected
networks (onto the set of nodes represented by MPs) and proceed to the study of the dynamical changes
of their topology, including community structure. By performing this longitudinal network analysis,
we can observe the evolution of the New Zealand parliamentary topic network and its main parties
in the period studied.
