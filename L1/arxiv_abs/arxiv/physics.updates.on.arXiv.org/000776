The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people seek out information that supports their
views and eschew information that conflicts with their beliefs, and that has negative consequences
on our society. Few researchers have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social
media: users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what happens after
exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure, though. Users might well be exposed
to diverse articles but share only the partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook:
the tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid conflicting
ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes
across individuals (e.g., depending on their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g.,
around elections); and 4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong
evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the real world, we built
a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political program, resulting in a controlled experiment
involving more than 70 individuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan
sharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality. However, we do also find positive
aspects of partisan sharing: it is associated with people who are more knowledgeable about politics
and engage more with it as they are more likely to vote in the general elections.
