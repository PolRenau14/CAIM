Phononic crystals have been widely employed in many engineering fields, which is due to their unique
feature of frequency band gaps. For example, their capability to filter out the incoming elastic
waves, which include seismic waves, will have a significant impact on the seismic safety of nuclear
infrastructure. In order to accurately design the desired frequency band gaps, one must pay attention
on how the input parameters and the interaction of the parameters can affect the frequency band gaps.
Global sensitivity analysis can decompose the dispersion relationship of the phononic crystals
and screen the variance attributed to each of the parameters and the interaction between them. Prior
to the application in one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals, this paper will first review the
theory of global sensitivity analysis using variance decomposition (Sobol sensitivity analysis).
Afterwards, the sensitivity analysis is applied to study a simple mathematical model with three
input variables for better understanding of the concept. Then, the sensitivity analysis is utilized
to study the characteristic of the first frequency band gap in 1D phononic crystals with respect
to the input parameters. This study reveals the quantified influence of the parameters and their
correlation in determining the first frequency band gap. In addition, simple straight-forward
design equations based on reduced Sobol functions are proposed to easily estimate the first frequency
band gap. Finally, the error associated with the proposed design equations is also addressed.
