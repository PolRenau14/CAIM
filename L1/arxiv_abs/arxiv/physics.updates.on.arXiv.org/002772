In this work we propose to validate the predictive capabilities of one-dimensional (1D) blood flow
models with full three-dimensional (3D) models in the context of patient-specific coronary hemodynamics
in hyperemic conditions. Such conditions mimic the state of coronary circulation during the acquisition
of the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) index. Demonstrating that 1D models accurately reproduce
FFR estimates obtained with 3D models has implications in the approach to computationally estimate
FFR. To this end, a sample of 20 patients was employed from which 29 3D geometries of arterial trees
were constructed, 9 obtained from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and 20 from
intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS). For each 3D arterial model, a 1D counterpart was generated.
The same outflow and inlet pressure boundary conditions were applied to both (3D and 1D) models.
In the 1D setting, pressure losses at stenoses and bifurcations were accounted for through specific
lumped models. Comparisons between 1D models ($\text{FFR}_{\text{1D}}$) and 3D models ($\text{FFR}_{\text{3D}}$)
were performed in terms of predicted $\text{FFR}$ value. Compared to $\text{FFR}_{\text{3D}}$,
$\text{FFR}_{\text{1D}}$ resulted with a difference of 0.00$\pm$0.03 and overall predictive
capability AUC, Acc, Spe, Sen, PPV and NPV of 0.97, 0.98, 0.90, 0.99, 0.82, and 0.99, with an FFR threshold
of 0.8. We conclude that inexpensive $\text{FFR}_{\text{1D}}$ simulations can be reliably used
as a surrogate of demanding $\text{FFR}_{\text{3D}}$ computations.
