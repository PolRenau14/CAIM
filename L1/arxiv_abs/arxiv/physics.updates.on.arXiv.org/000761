The network topology can be described by the number of nodes and the interconnections among them.
The degree of a node in a network is the number of connections it has to other nodes and the degree distribution
is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network. Therefore, the degree
is very important structural parameter of network topology. However, given the number of nodes
and the degree of each node in a network, the topology of the network cannot be determined. Therefore,
we propose the degree-layer theory of network topology to describe deeply the network topology.
First, we propose the concept of degree-tree with the breadth-first search tree. The degrees of
all nodes are layered and have a hierarchical structure. Second,the degree-layer theory is described
in detail. Two new concepts are defined in the theory. An index is proposed to quantitatively distinguish
the two network topologies. It also can quantitatively measure the stability of network topology
built by a model mechanism. One theorem is given and proved, furthermore, and one corollary is derived
directly from the theorem. Third, the applications of the degree-layer theory are discussed in
the ER random network, WS small world network and BA scale-free network, and the influences of the
degree distribution on the stability of network topology are studied in the three networks. In conclusion,
the degree-layer theory is helpful for accurately describing the network topology, and provides
a new starting point for researching the similarity and isomorphism between two network topologies.
