Bursty dynamics is a common temporal property of various complex systems in Nature but it also characterises
the dynamics of human actions and interactions. At the phenomenological level it is a feature of
all systems that evolve heterogeneously over time by alternating between periods of low and high
event frequencies. In such systems, bursts are identified as periods in which the events occur with
a rapid pace within a short time-interval while these periods are separated by long periods of time
with low frequency of events. As such dynamical patterns occur in a wide range of natural phenomena,
their observation, characterisation, and modelling have been a long standing challenge in several
fields of research. However, due to some recent developments in communication and data collection
techniques it has become possible to follow digital traces of actions and interactions of humans
from the individual up to the societal level. This led to several new observations of bursty phenomena
in the new but largely unexplored area of human dynamics, which called for the renaissance to study
these systems using research concepts and methodologies, including data analytics and modelling.
As a result, a large amount of new insight and knowledge as well as innovations have been accumulated
in the field, which provided us a timely opportunity to write this brief monograph to make an up-to-date
review and summary of the observations, appropriate measures, modelling, and applications of
heterogeneous bursty patterns occurring in the dynamics of human behaviour.
