Inhomogeneous drift-wave turbulence can be modeled as an effective plasma where drift waves act
as quantumlike particles and the zonal-flow velocity serves as a collective field through which
they interact. This effective plasma can be described by a Wigner-Moyal equation (WME), which generalizes
the quasilinear wave-kinetic equation (WKE) to the full-wave regime, i.e., resolves the wavelength
scale. Unlike waves governed by manifestly quantumlike equations, whose WMEs can be borrowed from
quantum mechanics and are commonly known, drift waves have Hamiltonians very different from those
of conventional quantum particles. This causes unusual phase-space dynamics that is typically
not captured by the WKE. We demonstrate how to correctly model this dynamics with the WME instead.
Specifically, we report full-wave phase-space simulations of the zonal-flow formation (zonostrophic
instability), deterioration (tertiary instability), and the so-called predator-prey oscillations.
We also show how the WME facilitates analysis of these phenomena, namely, (i) we show that full-wave
effects critically affect the zonostrophic instability, particularly, its nonlinear stage and
saturation; (ii) we derive the tertiary-instability growth rate; and (iii) we demonstrate that,
with full-wave effects retained, the predator-prey oscillations do not require zonal-flow collisional
damping, contrary to previous studies. We also show how the famous Rayleigh-Kuo criterion, which
has been missing in wave-kinetic theories of drift-wave turbulence, emerges from the WME.
