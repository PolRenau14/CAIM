Rule-based methods are often used for assigning fiber orientation to cardiac anatomical models.
However, existing methods have been developed using data mostly from the left ventricle. As a consequence,
fiber information obtained from rule-based methods often does not match histological data in other
areas of the heart such as the right ventricle, having a negative impact in cardiac simulations beyond
the left ventricle. In this work, we present a rule-based method where fiber orientation is separately
modeled in each ventricle following observations from histology. This allows to create detailed
fiber orientation in specific regions such as the endocardium of the right ventricle, the interventricular
septum and the outflow tracts. We also carried out electrophysiological simulations involving
these structures and with different fiber configurations. In particular, we built a modelling
pipeline for creating patient-specific volumetric meshes of biventricular geometries, including
the outflow tracts, and subsequently simulate the electrical wavefront propagation in outflow
tract ventricular arrhythmias with different origins for the ectopic focus. The resulting simulations
with the proposed rule-based method showed a very good agreement with clinical parameters such
as the 10 ms isochrone ratio in a cohort of nine patients suffering from this type of arrhythmia. The
developed modelling pipeline confirms its potential for an in silico identification of the site
of origin in outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias before clinical intervention.
