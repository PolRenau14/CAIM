Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is becoming increasingly prevalent
in society. However, little is known about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we
use a framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships
that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal
traits of the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender,
age) and acquired traits (geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found
that homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar traits, had a
mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for acquired traits, in which mobilization
speed was faster when the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In
contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had
other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other
males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits
also mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization,
and decreased in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media). These
findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike other, more passive forms
of social activity propagation. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social
mobilization tasks for increased speed.
