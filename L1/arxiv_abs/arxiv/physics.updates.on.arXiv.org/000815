Reputation is an important social construct in science, which enables informed quality assessments
of both publications and careers of scientists in the absence of complete systemic information.
However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood,
despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here we develop an
original framework for measuring how a publication's citation rate $\Delta c$ depends on the reputation
of its central author $i$, in addition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the
reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly-cited scientists,
using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation
crossover $c_{\times}$ which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications
with $c < c_{\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate.
Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase
in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes
negligible for highly cited publications meaning that for $c\geq c_{\times}$ the citation rate
measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition we have developed a stochastic reputation
model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing
insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.
