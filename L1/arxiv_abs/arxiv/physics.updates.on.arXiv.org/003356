The article deals with the problem of intellectual development of students in learning of physics
by means of computer simulation. The main objectives of teaching computer simulation in learning
of physics is the general outlook development, mastery of modelling as a method of knowledge, the
development of practical skills of computer simulation, the implementation of inter-subject
relationship, development and professionalization of computer skills, building skills of project
activities. It is shown that the means of computer simulation of physical processes is one of the
components of intellectual learning environment. It is spoken in detail about classification
of simulation software such as software of demonstration and modelling and educational software
tools which means environment of activity. Using software of demonstration and modelling allows
for establish interdisciplinary communication, improve the quality of knowledge, create a positive
motivation, enhance student interest in the subject. Educational software tools which means environment
of activity is an intelligent educational systems, the use of which contributes to the understanding
of the essence of the logical relationship between the original and models, especially the construction
of models, form the students an idea of modelling as a method of learning about the world. Accordingly
the adequate use of educational software tools which means environment of activity in learning
of physics is contribute to the development of intelligence of students.
