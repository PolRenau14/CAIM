Detecting communities in large-scale networks is a challenging task when each vertex may belong
to multiple communities, as is often the case in social networks. The multiple memberships of vertices
and thus the strong overlaps among communities render many detection algorithms invalid. We develop
a Partial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) for detecting communities with significant overlaps
as well as slightly overlapping and disjoint ones. It is a bottom-up approach based on properly reassembling
partial information of communities revealed in ego networks of vertices to reconstruct complete
communities. Noise control and merger order are the two key issues in implementing this idea. We
propose a novel similarity measure between two merged communities that can suppress noise and an
efficient algorithm that recursively merges the most similar pair of communities. The validity
and accuracy of PCMA is tested against two benchmarks and compared to four existing algorithms.
It is the most efficient one with linear complexity and it outperforms the compared algorithms when
vertices have multiple memberships. PCMA is applied to two huge online social networks, Friendster
and Sina Weibo. Millions of communities are detected and they are of higher qualities than the corresponding
metadata groups. We find that the latter should not be regarded as the ground-truth of structural
communities. The significant overlapping pattern found in the detected communities confirms
the need of new algorithms, such as PCMA, to handle multiple memberships of vertices in social networks.
