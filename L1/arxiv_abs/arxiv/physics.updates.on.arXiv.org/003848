In this study, the gravitational octree code originally optimized for the Fermi, Kepler, and Maxwell
GPU architectures is adapted to the Volta architecture. The Volta architecture introduces independent
thread scheduling requiring either the insertion of the explicit synchronizations at appropriate
locations or the enforcement of the same implicit synchronizations as do the Pascal or earlier architectures
by specifying \texttt{-gencode arch=compute\_60,code=sm\_70}. The performance measurements
on Tesla V100, the current flagship GPU by NVIDIA, revealed that the $N$-body simulations of the
Andromeda galaxy model with $2^{23} = 8388608$ particles took $3.8 \times 10^{-2}$~s or $3.3 \times
10^{-2}$~s per step for each case. Tesla V100 achieves a 1.4 to 2.2-fold acceleration in comparison
with Tesla P100, the flagship GPU in the previous generation. The observed speed-up of 2.2 is greater
than 1.5, which is the ratio of the theoretical peak performance of the two GPUs. The independence
of the units for integer operations from those for floating-point number operations enables the
overlapped execution of integer and floating-point number operations. It hides the execution
time of the integer operations leading to the speed-up rate above the theoretical peak performance
ratio. Tesla V100 can execute $N$-body simulation with up to $25 \times 2^{20} = 26214400$ particles,
and it took $2.0 \times 10^{-1}$~s per step. It corresponds to $3.5$~TFlop/s, which is 22\% of the
single-precision theoretical peak performance.
