A linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous cooling
state is carried out to identify the conditions for stability of a granular gas of rough hard spheres.
The description is based on the results for the transport coefficients derived from the Boltzmann
equation for inelastic rough hard spheres [Phys. Rev. E 90, 022205 (2014)], which take into account
the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients and the cooling rate on the coefficients
of normal and tangential restitution. As expected, linear stability analysis shows that a doubly
degenerate transversal (shear) mode and a longitudinal ("heat") mode are unstable with respect
to long enough wavelength excitations. The instability is driven by the shear mode above a certain
inelasticity threshold; at larger inelasticity, however, the instability is driven by the heat
mode for an inelasticity-dependent range of medium roughness. Comparison with the case of a granular
gas of inelastic smooth spheres confirms previous simulation results about the dual role played
by surface friction: while small and large levels of roughness make the system less unstable than
the frictionless system, the opposite happens at medium roughness. On the other hand, such an intermediate
window of roughness values shrinks as inelasticity increases and eventually disappears at a certain
value, beyond which the rough-sphere gas is always less unstable than the smooth-sphere gas. A comparison
with some preliminary simulation results shows a very good agreement for conditions of practical
interest.
