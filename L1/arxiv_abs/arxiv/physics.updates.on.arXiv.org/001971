A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion
-- the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature
suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting
parties in a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic
opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that modify people's susceptibility to
persuasion. In this work, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and we formalize
the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of
susceptibility. We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility lead to an interesting
family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that the questions are quite different
depending on whether there is an overall budget constraining the number of agents we can target or
not. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum
of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem
is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular.
Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization and show its efficacy at finding
target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions compared on real world networks, including a Twitter
network with real opinion estimates.
