Experiments on single crystal Li$_X$FePO$_4$ (LFP) nanoparticles indicate rich nonequilibrium
phase behavior, such as suppression of phase separation at high lithiation rates, striped patterns
of coherent phase boundaries, nucleation by binarysolid surface wetting and intercalation waves.
These observations have been successfully predicted (prior to the experiments) by 1D depth-averaged
phase-field models, which neglect any subsurface phase separation. In this paper, using an electro-chemo-mechanical
phase-field model, we investigate the coherent non-equilibrium subsurface phase morphologies
that develop in the $ab$- plane of platelet-like single-crystal platelet-like Li$_X$FePO$_4$
nanoparticles. Finite element simulations are performed for 2D plane-stress conditions in the
$ab$- plane, and validated by 3D simulations, showing similar results. We show that the anisotropy
of the interfacial tension tensor, coupled with electroautocatalytic surface intercalation
reactions, plays a crucial role in determining the subsurface phase morphology. With isotropic
interfacial tension, subsurface phase separation is observed, independent of the reaction kinetics,
but for strong anisotropy, phase separation is controlled by surface reactions, as assumed in 1D
models. Moreover, the driven intercalation reaction suppresses phase separation during lithiation,
while enhancing it during delithiation, by electro-autocatalysis, in quantitative agreement
with {\it in operando} imaging experiments in single-crystalline nanoparticles, given measured
reaction rate constants.
