Understanding community structure of social media is critical due to its broad applications such
as friend recommendations, user modeling and content personalizations. Existing research uses
structural metrics such as modularity and conductance and functional metrics such as ground truth
to measure the qualify of the communities discovered by various community detection algorithms,
while overlooking a natural and important dimension, community size. Recently, anthropologist
Dunbar suggests that the size of stable community in social media should be limited to 150, referred
to as Dunbar's number. In this study, we propose a systematic way of algorithm comparison by orthogonally
integrating community size as a new dimension into existing structural metrics for consistently
and holistically evaluating the community quality in social media context. we design a heuristic
clique based algorithm which controls the size and overlap of communities with adjustable parameters
and evaluate it along with five state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on both Twitter
network and DBLP network. Specifically, we divide the discovered communities based on their size
into four classes called close friend, casual friend, acquaintance, and just a face, and then calculate
the coverage, modularity, triangle participation ratio, conductance, transitivity, and the
internal density of communities in each class. We discover that communities in different classes
exhibit diverse structural qualities and many existing community detection algorithms tend to
output extremely large communities.
