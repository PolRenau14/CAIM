The identification of meaningful reaction coordinates plays a key role in the study of complex molecular
systems whose essential dynamics is characterized by rare or slow transition events. In a recent
publication, precise defining characteristics of such reaction coordinates were identified
and linked to the existence of a so-called transition manifold. This theory gives rise to a novel
numerical method for the pointwise computation of reaction coordinates that relies on short parallel
MD simulations only, but yields accurate approximation of the long time behavior of the system under
consideration. This article presents an extension of the method towards practical applicability
in computational chemistry. It links the newly defined reaction coordinates to concepts from transition
path theory and Markov state model building. The main result is an alternative computational scheme
that allows for a global computation of reaction coordinates based on commonly available types
of simulation data, such as single long molecular trajectories, or the push-forward of arbitrary
canonically-distributed point clouds. It is based on a Galerkin approximation of the transition
manifold reaction coordinates, that can be tuned to individual requirements by the choice of the
Galerkin ansatz functions. Moreover, we propose a ready-to-implement variant of the new scheme,
that computes data-fitted, mesh-free ansatz functions directly from the available simulation
data. The efficacy of the new method is demonstrated on a small protein system.
