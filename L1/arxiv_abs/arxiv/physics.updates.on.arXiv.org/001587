Inspired by Christopher Alexanders conception of the world - space is not lifeless or neutral but
a living structure involving far more small things than large ones a topological representation
has been previously developed to characterize the living structure or the wholeness of geographic
space. This paper further develops the topological representation and living structure for predicting
human activities in geographic space. Based on millions of street nodes of the United Kingdom extracted
from OpenStreetMap, we established living structures at different levels of scale in a nested manner.
We found that tweet locations at different levels of scale, such as country and city, can be well predicted
by the underlying living structure. The high predictability demonstrates that the living structure
and the topological representation are efficient and effective for better understanding geographic
forms. Based on this major finding, we argue that the topological representation is a truly multi-scale
representation, and point out that existing geographic representations are essentially single
scale, so they bear many scale problems such as modifiable areal unit problem, the conundrum of length,
and the ecological fallacy. We further discuss on why the living structure is an efficient and effective
instrument for structuring geospatial big data, and why Alexanders organic worldview constitutes
the third view of space. Keywords: Organic worldview, topological representation, tweet locations,
