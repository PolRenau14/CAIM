The purpose of the present paper is to study the influence of wall-echo on pressure fluctuations
$p'$, and on statistical correlations containing $p'$, {\em viz} redistribution $\phi_{ij}$,
pressure diffusion $d_{ij}^{(p)}$, and velocity/pressure-gradient $\Pi_{ij}$. We extend the
usual analysis of turbulent correlations containing pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded \tsc{dns}
computations [Kim J.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 205} (1989) 421--451], separating $p'$ not only
into rapid $p_{(\mathrm{r})}'$ and slow $p_{(\mathrm{s})}'$ parts [Chou P.Y.: {\em Quart. Appl.
Math.} {\bf 3} (1945) 38--54], but further into volume ($p'_{(\mathrm{r};\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(\mathrm{s};\mathfrak{V})}$) and surface (wall-echo; $p'_{(\mathrm{r};w)}$ and $p'_{(\mathrm{s};w)}$)
terms. An algorithm, based on a Green's function approach, is developed to compute the above splittings
for various correlations containing pressure fluctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion,
velocity/pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel flow. This exact analysis
confirms previous results based on a method-of-images approximation [Manceau R., Wang M., Laurence
D.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 438} (2001) 307--338] showing that, at the wall, $p'_{(\mathfrak{V})}$
and $p'_{(w)}$ are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above results are then used
to study the contribution of each mechanism on the pressure correlations in low Reynolds-number
plane channel flow, and to discuss standard second-moment-closure modelling practices.
