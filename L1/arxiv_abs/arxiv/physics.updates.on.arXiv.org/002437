The process by which new communities emerge is a central research issue in the social sciences. While
a growing body of research analyzes the formation of a single community by examining social networks
between individuals, we introduce a novel community-centered perspective. We highlight the fact
that the context in which a new community emerges contains numerous existing communities. We reveal
the emerging process of communities by tracing their early members' previous community memberships.
Our testbed is Reddit, a website that consists of tens of thousands of user-created communities.
We analyze a dataset that spans over a decade and includes the posting history of users on Reddit from
its inception to April 2017. We first propose a computational framework for building genealogy
graphs between communities. We present the first large-scale characterization of such genealogy
graphs. Surprisingly, basic graph properties, such as the number of parents and max parent weight,
converge quickly despite the fact that the number of communities increases rapidly over time. Furthermore,
we investigate the connection between a community's origin and its future growth. Our results show
that strong parent connections are associated with future community growth, confirming the importance
of existing community structures in which a new community emerges. Finally, we turn to the individual
level and examine the characteristics of early members. We find that a diverse portfolio across
existing communities is the most important predictor for becoming an early member in a new community.
