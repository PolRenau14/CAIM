Tungsten is the main candidate material for plasma-facing armour components in future fusion reactors.
In-service, fusion neutron irradiation creates lattice defects through collision cascades.
Helium, injected from plasma, aggravates damage by increasing defect retention. Both can be mimicked
using helium-ion-implantation. In a recent study on 3000 appm helium-implanted tungsten (W-3000He),
we hypothesized helium-induced irradiation hardening, followed by softening during deformation.
The hypothesis was founded on observations of large increase in hardness, substantial pile-up
and slip-step formation around nano-indents and Laue diffraction measurements of localised deformation
underlying indents. Here we test this hypothesis by implementing it in a crystal plasticity finite
element (CPFE) formulation, simulating nano-indentation in W-3000He at 300 K. The model considers
thermally-activated dislocation glide through helium-defect obstacles, whose barrier strength
is derived as a function of defect concentration and morphology. Only one fitting parameter is used
for the simulated helium-implanted tungsten; defect removal rate. The simulation captures the
localised large pile-up remarkably well and predicts confined fields of lattice distortions and
geometrically necessary dislocation underlying indents which agree quantitatively with previous
Laue measurements. Strain localisation is further confirmed through high resolution electron
backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements on cross-section
lift-outs from centre of nano-indents in W-3000He.
