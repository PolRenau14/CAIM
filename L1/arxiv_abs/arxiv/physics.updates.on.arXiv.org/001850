Resource diffusion is an ubiquitous phenomenon, but how it impacts epidemic spreading has received
little study. We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex
networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes
are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer.
The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon
the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly
in this model. To quantify the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls
the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential
resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the
degree of interlayer correlation is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes
the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer
correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to
first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also
find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where
the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally suppressed. In addition,
the optimal controlling parameter increases as the degree of inter-layer correlation increases.
