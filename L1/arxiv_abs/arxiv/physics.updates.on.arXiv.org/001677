We develop an agent-based model to reproduce the size distribution of R\&D alliances of firms. Agents
are uniformly selected to initiate an alliance and to invite collaboration partners. These decide
about acceptance based on an individual threshold that is compared with the utility expected from
joining the current alliance. The benefit of alliances results from the fitness of the agents involved.
Fitness is obtained from an empirical distribution of agent's activities. The cost of an alliance
reflects its coordination effort. Two free parameters $a_{c}$ and $a_{l}$ scale the costs and the
individual threshold. If initiators receive $R$ rejections of invitations, the alliance formation
stops and another initiator is selected. The three free parameters $(a_{c},a_{l},R)$ are calibrated
against a large scale data set of about 15,000 firms engaging in about 15,000 R\&D alliances over
26 years. For the validation of the model we compare the empirical size distribution with the theoretical
one, using confidence bands, to find a very good agreement. As an asset of our agent-based model,
we provide an analytical solution that allows to reduce the simulation effort considerably. The
analytical solution applies to general forms of the utility of alliances. Hence, the model can be
extended to other cases of alliance formation. While no information about the initiators of an alliance
is available, our results indicate that mostly firms with high fitness are able to attract newcomers
and to establish larger alliances.
