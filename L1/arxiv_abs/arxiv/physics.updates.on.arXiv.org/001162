We propose DeepBreath, a deep learning model which automatically recognises people's psychological
stress level (mental overload) from their breathing patterns. Using a low cost thermal camera,
we track a person's breathing patterns as temperature changes around his/her nostril. The paper's
technical contribution is threefold. First of all, instead of creating hand-crafted features
to capture aspects of the breathing patterns, we transform the uni-dimensional breathing signals
into two dimensional respiration variability spectrogram (RVS) sequences. The spectrograms
easily capture the complexity of the breathing dynamics. Second, a spatial pattern analysis based
on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is directly applied to the spectrogram sequences without
the need of hand-crafting features. Finally, a data augmentation technique, inspired from solutions
for over-fitting problems in deep learning, is applied to allow the CNN to learn with a small-scale
dataset from short-term measurements (e.g., up to a few hours). The model is trained and tested with
data collected from people exposed to two types of cognitive tasks (Stroop Colour Word Test, Mental
Computation test) with sessions of different difficulty levels. Using normalised self-report
as ground truth, the CNN reaches 84.59% accuracy in discriminating between two levels of stress
and 56.52% in discriminating between three levels. In addition, the CNN outperformed powerful
shallow learning methods based on a single layer neural network. Finally, the dataset of labelled
thermal images will be open to the community.
