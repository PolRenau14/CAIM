Using the Einstein energy-mass relation and a concept of cross-correlating material unit-fields
(pp. 1-148), the quantum equation for united gravitation and electromagnetism is derived (pp.
148-164). The unified equation yields all known solutions to the Dirac equation, for example, the
fine and hyperfine structure of the atom spectrum. Moreover, the model explains physical nature
of the spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle.
For weak fields, in the classical limit, the model simplifies to the Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism
and the so-called gravitoelectromagnetic approximation of Einstein's general relativity. In
case of the strong fields, the unified model yields new predictions compared to the Einstein gravity,
Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. For instance, the cross-correlation
of gravitational and electric potentials predicts the "anti-gravity force". The "dark matter"
and "dark energy" also find natural explanations in the present model. For the unit-fields carrying
the gravitational, electric and strong-nuclear "dressings", the quantum equation and its classical
limit for the united gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields
and interactions are derived (pp. 164-183). The cross-correlation of electric and strong-nuclear
potentials of the electric and strong-nuclear "dressings" explains the physical nature of weak-nuclear
force. Whereas, the cross-correlation of gravitational and strong-nuclear potentials predicts
the new kind of interactions, namely the gravito-nuclearstrong force.
